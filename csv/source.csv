India has a history of deadly road accidents. In 2015, the total number of traffic accidents increased 2.5 percent to 501,423, from 489,400 in 2014, according to the country's transport and highways ministry. Traffic-related deaths increased 4.6 percent to 146,133 in 2015, from 139,671 in 2014. 
Around 83.6 percent of traffic-related deaths occurred in India's top thirteen states during 2015. The highest number of deaths had taken place in Uttar Pradesh, which reported 17,666 fatalities. 
India sees an average of 1,374 traffic accidents a day -- as well as 400 deaths every day -- on roads. 
This equates to almost one accident per minute and one death every four minutes on roads -- making it a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS and other diseases, according to the World Health Organization. 
In a pair of particularly deadly incidents only two days apart last year in India, at least 29 people were killed -- including 17 children -- when two buses plunged into water. 
During a 2013 road safety campaign, the ministry said many of these incidents were due to drunk driving, a scourge it said needed to eliminated by spreading awareness and stringent enforcement measures. It added that state governments have been requested to remove liquor shops from the side of highways.

An Anti-Terrorism Squad team reached Bihar on Wednesday to gather information on the recent train accident in Kanpur, in which Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence is suspected to have played a role. 
The Bihar police on Tuesday claimed to have unearthed a suspected ISI link in the train accident after arrest of three persons in East Champaran district of the state. Police claimed the trio had confessed to having worked for a Nepalese contact suspected to have links with the ISI. 
According to reports, Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and Mukesh Yadav were arrested from Motihari on the Indo-Nepal border. 
During interrogation, police claimed they confessed to having been paid Rs three lakh by a Nepali citizen identified as Brajesh Giri allegedly connected with the ISI for planting a bomb on railway tracks at Ghorasahan in East Champaran district. The bomb was, however, detected and later defused. 
Fifteen coaches of the Ajmer-Sealdah Express derailed near Rura, around 70 kilometres from Kanpur, on December 28. Though there were no deaths, 44 persons were injured in the accident. 
At least 151 were killed when the Indore-Patna Express derailed near Kanpur on November 21 last year.

13,ACCE005SRC002," Two major train accidents near Kanpur which resulted in deaths of 151 passengers and injuries to 200 others, were carried out on the instructions of Pakistan's external spy agency ISI , according to the Bihar police . 

The ISI hand was exposed following the arrest of three criminals Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and Mukesh Yadav from Motihari on the Indo-Nepal border who were working at the instance of an ISI agent, a Nepalese citizen based in Dubai. 

""These criminals were arrested for their involvement in placing a cooker bomb on the railway track near Ghorasahan in the district on October 1 last year. They have confessed to having worked for an ISI agent,"" district SP Jitender Rana told TOI over phone, adding one of them confessed to his involvement in planting explosives to derail the Indore-Patna Express and Ajmer-Sealdah Express trains near Kanpur last year. 

The disclosure marks a new dimension of the subversion carried out by ISI, and has exposed the vulnerability of railways to terrorists. With the case throwing up clear external linkages with conspirators based in Nepal, Pakistan and UAE, the NIA is closely following the investigation by the Bihar police. 

""Our team of investigators are in touch with the local police and will examine the disclosures made by the arrested accused. If our preliminary conclusions vet the ISI-link theory, there is a possibility of NIA taking over the investigation,"" said an NIA official. 

Those involved in the plot could have killed many more if they had succeeded in derailing a passenger train by setting off an explosion on a rail track. Also, a major train accident was foiled on January 1 by the railway patrolling staff, who detected that 50 elastic rail clips and three pairs of fishplates were removed and deliberate damage caused by a hacksaw on the track between Kalyanpur and Mandhana stations in the Farrukhabad-Kanpur Anwarganj section. 

Railways has already asked CBI to inquire into the incident which happened a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address a political rally in Lucknow. 

""Fortunately, the bomb at Ghorasahan was detected with the help of villagers and defused,"" Rana said about the attempt by the trio to cause an accident in East Champaran district of Bihar on October 1 last year. 

Passengers of the Indore-Patna Express were not so lucky. At least 151 were killed when the train flew off the track on November 21 last year + . Just over a month later, more than 50 people were injured when Ajmer-Sealdah Express derailed + , again near Kanpur, on December 28. 

Rana said the trio had received around Rs 3 lakh till now from Brij Kishore Giri for engineering train accidents. Brij is a Nepali citizen. He along with Shambhu Giri and Mujahir Ansari was arrested by Nepal police recently. ""The Nepal police have shared vital information with us regarding their ISI links,"" Rana said, adding that the state ATS (anti-terrorism squad) and other security agencies have been informed about their confession. RPF is also in touch with the Bihar police and is coordinating efforts to reach the bottom of the conspiracy. 

Rana said Motilal was earlier a Maoist operating in Adapur block of East Champaran district. ""Umashankar has at least four criminals cases against him while 12 cases are lodged against Motilal and Mukesh,"" the SP said, adding investigations were on to gather information on the main handler of the gang. 

Police officials are verifying if Motilal was the area commander of an extremist group, an assumption which if proved correct, will suggest that concerns over ISI enlisting local disaffected groups may have come true. 

Sources said Motilal told police he had planted explosives on the tracks near Kanpur for derailing the two trains. ""Brij had received funds from Dubai for the purpose. Brij had promised flats, vehicles and finances to produce a Bhojpuri movie to the trio arrested from Motihari,"" said a police officer involved in the interrogation. 

Police have now launched a manhunt for two others, identified as Gajendra Sharma and Rakesh Yadav, who are said to be hiding in East Champaran, the sources said.

 The train derailment in Kanpur on November 21, in which 150 passengers were killed, might have been planned and funded by anti-India elements based in Dubai, according to a sensational disclosure by police in Biharâs East Champaran district on Tuesday. 
The arrest of three criminals linked to the planting of a bomb on the rail tracks in Biharâs Raxaul district on October 1 has allowed police in East Champaran district a glimpse into a network of anti-India elements with likely links with Pakistanâs ISI paying money to criminals in India to carry out blasts and sabotage action on rail tracks in the country. 
âThe recovery of an improvised explosive device on on Raxaul-Sitamarhi route near Ghorasahan railway station on October 1, which disrupted train services for more than 12 hours, was funded by a Dubai-based trader from Nepal named Shamshul Hoda,â said East Champaran SP Jitendra Rana. âThere is a possibility that the derailment of Indore-Patna Express and the Shealdah-Ajmer Express were also carried out by these people. Efforts are on to find out more details from the ongoing interrogation,â he added. 
Moti Paswan, a criminal who is the main accused in the Ghorasahan case, and two others who were arrested have reportedly confessed to police that they were paid a âbig amountâ by Hoda to carry out blasts on rail tracks in north India. Police stumbled on the racket while investigating the murder of two Raxaul residents in Nepal. 
âThree people arrested in Nepal â Brijkishore Giri, Muzahid Ansari and Shambhu â and two other men were active in this group. Giri, the kingpin, had paid money to these people to carry out blasts on rail tracks near Ghorasahan. Umashankar Patel, Mukesh Yadav and Moti Paswan, who have been arrested, had received the money and given the bomb planting task to two other men,â said Rana. 
After police detected and recovered the powerful IED and averted a major accident, the two men were punished for their failure. âThey were taken to Nepal and brutally killed in a jungle there. Investigation into these two murders unravelled the sinister network,â said Rana. 
Police are taking help of ATS and intelligence agencies to explore the entire extent of this network. âThe involvement of some agencies from across the border has been detected. Further probe will expose the exact role of these agencies and the likelihood that they were behind the Kanpur derailment,â said Rana.

When they were about to start, people standing in queue rushed to get on to the vessel, causing the crush. ""As a result, some of the barricades broke. Some devotees who fell into the water were rescued,"" Hajra said.

No human negligence behind boiler blast: Power Minister Agency Report | New Delhi/Rae Bareli | 2 November, 2017 | 11:30 PM Power producer NTPC has shut down a 500 MW unit at its Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station in Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh following the accident on Wednesday that claimed the lives of 30 people. Share this: Print 
The company in a regulatory filing on the BSE said: âThis is to inform that Unit 6 (500 MW) of Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station, Rae Bareli, is under shut down after an accident in the evening of November 1, 2017. The other five units of the station are operating normally.â 
The death toll in the NTPC boiler blast here in Uttar Pradesh rose to 26 on Thursday, with more injured workers succumbing to their burn injuries, officials said. 
The massive explosion took place in a 500 MW boiler unit in Unchahar town on the Lucknow-Allahabad highway. Many were trapped when a fire erupted in the boiler and a huge ball of dust rose after the blast, making the rescue operations difficult. 
On Thursday, contractual labourers at the plant raised slogans against the NTPC management. They claimed they had warned about an impending disaster at unit six as the temperature near the furnace had been steadily rising. 
The NTPC has launched a probe into the incident, which it said took place due to âexcess ash depositionâ in the furnace. The state government has ordered a magisterial probe. Union Power Minister R.K. Singh on Thursday denied claims by some political leaders and families of the deceased that human negligence was to blame for the boiler blast in NTPCâs Unchahar unit here that left 30 dead and dozens seriously injured. 
âI have seen everything during my physical inspection of the accident scene and I can say that there is no human negligence in the unfortunate incident,â Singh told reporters, after visiting the accident site along with state Power Minister Shrikant Sharma. 
He also announced that the Central government has decided to give financial assistance of Rs 20 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 10 lakh each to the critically injured, while those who sustained minor injuries would get Rs 2 lakh each, the Union Minister announced. 
This compensation would be in addition to the ex-gratia and financial assistance announced by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. 
The state-run National Thermal Power Corp (NTPC) has also announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the dead. The Prime Ministerâs Relief Fund will also give Rs 2 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased. 
R.K. Singh also said that the priority of the government, both at the Centre and the state, was to save as many lives as possible, provide the best, prompt and adequate treatment. 
Singh also said that NTPCâs Unchahar unit was among the best in the country and that rumours that there was an extra load on it or that it was under pressure to increase production were unfounded and baseless. 
How and why the accident happened would be conclusively found and detailed in the probe ordered by the Ministry which would be completed in 30 days, he added. 
State Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, who also visited Rae Bareli on Thursday, urged the opposition parties not to make political currency out of the tragic incident. 
âBoth the state and Union governments are saddened by the tragedy and are doing all they can to bring relief to the affected,â he said and added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was personally very sad at the loss of lives in the accident. (IANS) Share this:",ACCIDENT

(PTI Photo ) 
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday demanded a judicial probe into the boiler blast at the state-run power giant NTPCâs Unchahar plant in which 29 people died and over 60 injured. 
He made the demand after visiting the district hospital in Rae Bareli, where the injured were undergoing treatment. 
âThe accident showed serious lapse in working of the unit and to know the reason behind it a judicial probe was needed,â Gandhi said during a brief interaction with media at the hospital. 
Congress vice-president rushed to Rae Bareli taking a break from his ongoing Navsarjan Yatra in poll-bound Gujarat. 
Rae Bareli is the parliamentary constituency of his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 
To ascertain the cause of the blast, the NTPC has initiated a probe amid allegations from labourers that they had warned about the possible disaster at the ill-fated unit-six as the temperature near the furnace was steadily rising. 
Gandhi consoled family members of victims who lost their lives in the blast and enquired about the condition of those admitted in the hospital. 
Later, the Amethi member of parliament also visited private hospitals, SIMHANS and Nirmal, and enquired about condition of blast victims admitted there. 
He also visited the site of boiler blast on NTPC premises and enquired about the accident from officials. 
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and UP Congress chief Raj Babbar accompanied the Congress vice president. 
âThe laxities in construction should be probed thoroughly as without a major lapse accident of such magnitude was not possible,â said Babbar. 
The 500 megawatt unit 6 of the power plant was commissioned in April but due to technical fault in the boiler it failed to produce power. 
âWe demand a judicial probe into the tragedy. Setting up of an enquiry committee by government is just eyewash,â reiterated Azad. 
During his visit to the blast site Gandhi came face to face with union power minister RK Singh, who also visited the plant and took stock of the situation. 
Singh denied any human negligence led to the blast. Army pays tribute to 2 soldiers killed in Pulwama encounter Nov 03, 2017 16:55 IST ",ACCIDENT

The Tum Mile star added that without make-up, an artiste is completely exposed. âI like such films because otherwise behind the glamour, you lose the depth of the character and in this you canât hide behind make-up at all. You are completely exposed and I find that challenging,â she said.

Also starring Vir Das, 31st October is based on the aftermath of Indira Gandhiâs assassination and its repercussions. Soha and Vir essay a Sikh couple in the movie, which will hit the screens on October 7.

The actress, who is the younger sister of actor Saif Ali Khan, says the film has shown the 1984 riots through the eyes of one family and that the makers chose to stay away from politics in the film.

âWe stayed away from politics in the film. Weâve shown the 1984 riots through the eyes of one family. It is a very humane take on what has happened. There are references to certain local leaders but we have not named them. But for people, who know enough about the 1984 riots, theyâll know exactly who we mean,â Soha said.",ARTS

With its strong and inspiring story plus brilliant performances of all actors, the movie has impressed all viewers and received super positive reviews from critics. These positive reactions have resulted in massive buzz about Dangal on social media and ground as well, this is why Nitesh Tiwariâs directorial still has excellent hold over the audience globally. It is not less than a miracle, that a movie is collecting double digit business figures after 10 days of its release. With its majestic run, Aamir Khan starrer has emerged as the fourth highest grossing movie of all time in Bollywood after his own 2014âs PK , Salman Khanâs Bajrangi Bhaijaan & Sultan . In the opening week, Dangal recorded phenomenal occupancy through out and did the business of 197.54 crores on domestic box office, including 107.01 crores of weekend and 90.53 crores of weekdays.

40,ARTE004SRC002,"Aamir Khan's Dangal has been on a record breaking spree at the worldwide box office and broken several old business records. But there are six business records Dhoom 3, PK and Sultan that the film has failed to break. 
The Aamir Khan-starrer, which released in theatres on December 23, has kept the cash registers ringing at the domestic ticket counters. Dangal has collected Rs 115.96 crore nett at the Indian box office, taking its 14-day domestic total collection to Rs 313.50 crore nett. The film has raked in a total of over $23.98 million (Rs 162.83 crore gross) at the overseas box office in two weeks. 
The Nitesh Tiwari-directed sports drama has surpassed many domestic and international collection records set by the previous Bollywood releases and has now set its own benchmarks. However, there are some records, which Dangal has failed to beat. Here are the details of those records: 
1. PK and Sultan collection in US premieres 
Aamir Khan's previous movie PK, which was released as a Christmas treat on 2014, collected $1 million at the US box office in the premiere shows and is the biggest Bollywood opener of all time in the US. Considering its hype and promotion, Dangal was expected to smash this record, but it failed to beat it by grossing $282,280 at US box office. It also failed to break the record of Sultan, which is in the second rank with its collection of $786,194. 
2. Dhoom 3 and Sultan first day collection in domestic market 
Dhoom 3 collected Rs 36.22 crore nett at the Indian box office on the first day and it is the biggest opener for Aamir Khan. On other hand, Sultan collected Rs 36.54 crore in the domestic market on its first day and is the biggest Bollywood opener of 2016. Dangal was expected to beat both these records, but failed to do so as it collected Rs 29.78 crore on its opening day. 
3. Dhoom 3 and Sultan opening weekend record in domestic market 
Dhoom 3 and Sultan collected Rs 107.61 crore nett and 180.36 crore nett, respectively, at the Indian box office in their opening weekend. Dangal collected Rs 107.01 crore nett at the domestic box office in its first weekend and failed to beat these records. 
4. Dhoom 3 and Sultan opening weekend record in international market 
Dhoom 3 and Sultan grossed $10.17 million (Rs 62.95 crore) and $13.7 million (Rs 91.93 crore), respectively, at the overseas box office in the first weekend of their release. Dangal could not beat this record as it collected $9 million (Rs 60.99 crore) in the international markets in its opening weekend. 
5. Sultan opening week record in domestic market 
Sultan collected Rs 229.16 crore nett at the Indian box office in the first week of its release and it is the all time highest grossing Hindi film in the opening week. Dangal could not beat the record of the Salman Khan starrer, as it collected Rs 197.54 crore nett at the domestic box office in its opening week. 
6. Opening week collection in international market 
Sultan and Dhoom 3 collected $17.46 million and $17.02 million at the overseas box office in their opening week, while Dangal raked in $15.01 million in the country. ",ARTS
41,ARTE004SRC003,"Aamir Khan's Dangal , which is on a record-breaking spree, has become the second highest grossing Hindi film after Aamir's PK. 
 Aamir Khan's film crosses Rs 300 crore mark 
It collected Rs 6.66 crore at the Indian box office on Friday (15 th day), thereby taking its total collection to Rs 320.16 crore net at the domestic market. ""#Dangal all set to cross #BajrangiBhaijaan *lifetime biz* today [Week 3] Fri 6.66 cr. Total: â¹ 320.16 cr. India biz. ATBB,"" trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted. 
The film requires another Rs 0.18 crore to surpass the lifetime collection of Salman Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan (the second highest grosser). Bajrangi Bhaijaan did a business of Rs 320.34 crore net at the Indian box office and as you read the story, Dangal may have already collected the required amount from the first few shows on Saturday (16th day) becoming the second highest grosser. 
Considering the pace at which the film is making money at the box office, it is likely to cross the lifetime collection of Aamir's PK, which earned Rs 340 crore net at the Indian box office, and emerge as the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time. 
Meanwhile, the Nitesh Tiwari directorial has already become the highest grossing Bollywood film of 2016, beating Salman's Sultan, which made Rs 300.45 crore net at the domestic box office. Until now, Dangal has broken several Bollywood film records. It is the first film to cross the Rs 300 crore mark at the domestic market in just 13 days of its release.

With a new beginning of 2017, the industry is gearing up for the much celebrated award ceremonies. The sole purpose for this is said to be a celebration of films and the incredible performances that have won hearts across the country and the globe. Ironically, these ceremonies are often considered frivolous by many from the film industry itself and actors like John Abraham and Aamir Khan have openly expressed their dislike towards it. Despite the fact that often some of these award ceremonies have been ridiculed for the kind of favoritism they showcase, this time around, the popular Filmfare awards is already surrounded by controversy with its nomination list for 2016. One look at the 62 nd Filmfare Award nominations and you will understand what we are talking about. 
Undoubtedly, Pink which starred Amitabh Bachchan , Taapsee Pannu in leading roles won hearts. The film represented the contemporary yet patriarchal ideas that come into play when a woman in the court stand tries to prove her innocence. When Kriti Kulhari and Taapsee Pannu continue to fight against the notion associated with modern Indian non-virgin girls who are labelled as sluts and prostitutes, it questions the very basis of a womanâs identity that is trapped amidst the male dominated Indian society. Pink impressed the critics and audiences alike for questioning this regressive mindset and fighting the corrupt system. 
Coming back to the Filmfare nominations, let us throw light on the fact that Taapsee Pannu hasnât been nominated for her stellar performance in Pink . Yes, the very film that asks you to celebrate womanhood and respect women and allow them to choose their way of life. How ironical! Amitabh Bachchan received the nomination for the Best Actor for the same film however the actressâ who plays the victim quite convincingly hasnât received even a mention in the Best Actress category. What is further surprising is that Kirti Kulhari received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for the same film. 
Though this definitely questions the little faith that is left in these awards, it doesnât end here. Akshay Kumar has been the only actor whose three films namely Airlift , Rustom and Housefull 3 have done extremely well in 2016. Even if one disregards Housefull 3 as a slapstick comedy, Akshayâs intense roles in the other two films is some of the best work of his career, which has been lapped up by the audiences. However, just like Tapsee, this superstar too has been conveniently dropped out of the nomination list. Seems like not even one of the three blockbuster hits of Akshay impressed the jury members of Filmfare awards. 
Funnily, the nominations include Shah Rukh Khan in the Best Actor category for Fan , a film that underperformed at the box office, whereas Akshay Kumarâs Rustom and Airlift which did well both box office wise as well as received critical appreciation have been ignored. Same goes for Best Actress nominations wherein though Pink performed way better than Sarbjit, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been nominated for Best Actress but not Tapsee Pannu. 
Interestingly, Akshay Kumar and Taapsee Pannu too have a connection. The two acted together in Baby and are doing another film Naam Shabana where the superstar is playing a cameo. So yet another question that pops up is if this has been a consequence of a camp war that is quite frequent in Bollywood? 
Yet another actor who has fallen victim to this kind of favoritism is none other than Manoj Bajpayee . His film Aligarh which is based on the real life incident of a homosexual professor who was dismissed from Aligarh University owing to his sexual orientation, brought forth the mean face of an orthodox society and the cruel existence of homophobia. While this film and Manoj Bajpayeeâs performance were celebrated even internationally with the actor winning several accolades abroad, itâs sad to see that the actor didnât receive any nomination. Funnily, here too, Rajkumar Rao got a nomination for the same film for Supporting Role. 
Popular film awards have already been under criticism for the past few years where every big actor who promises to attend the event is handed over a trophy. Most award functions these days are looked down upon as just another television programme. And now, with such bias shown by the oldest popular film awards, one wonders if these red carpet events are even worth our attention anymore. ",ARTS

After a long spell of 18 years, the three Khans of the Hindi film industry- Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir - will go head to head in the Best Actor category of the Filmfare Awards . Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. 
Filmfare has announced the nominations for 10 of its various categories for the 62nd Filmfare Awards . However, what is a special attraction in the awards show this year, besides the introduction of the Best Short Film category, is the fact that Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan have been nominated in the Best Actor in a Leading Role (Male) category. 
This is only the third time that the three actors have been nominated in this category, this year for their respective performances in Maneesh Sharma's Fan , Ali Abbas Zafar's Sultan and Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal . They join Amitabh Bachchan, for Aniruddha Roy Choudhary's Pink , Sushant Singh Rajput for Neeraj Pandey's MS Dhoni: The Untold Story , Shahid Kapoor for Abhishek Chaubey's Udta Punjab and Ranbir Kapoor for Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil . 
The last time the three Khans were nominated in the same year was two decades ago in 1999. 
Shah Rukh had managed to gain the upper hand then, bagging the coveted award for playing the boisterous-turned-balanced character of Rahul in Johar's directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. On the other hand, Aamir, who got nominated for Vikram Bhatt's Ghulam , and Salman, who got nominated for Sohail Khan's Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya , fell short. 
The only occasion prior to that when the three Khans were nominated was back in 1996 which also saw Shah Rukh gain the edge as he won the award for portraying the charming character of Raj in Aditya Chopra's directorial debut Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge . Aamir was nominated for Ram Gopal Varma's Rangeela whereas Salman made it to the nomination list for his performance in Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun . 
Shah Rukh, who is hosting the award show this year, also boasts of winning the maximum number of Filmfare Awards in this category as he stands tied with Dilip Kumar at eight awards each. While another win will enable him to break the thespian's record, it will be quite as task given the fierce competition from the other contenders including both Aamir and Salman who played retired Haryanavi wrestlers in their respective films last year. 
However, it is a well-known fact that Salman and Aamir do not hold awards shows in high regard. The former boycotted award shows long ago, in spite of winning two, for Raja Hindustani in 1997 and Lagaan in 2002 in the Best Actor in a Leading Role (Male) category. On the other hand, the latter only performs on the stage at awards shows but does not receive the award. Not that he has won (m)any. 
It is this notion of award shows being rigged that has enraged not only these two Khans but also cine goers this year. 
#filmfareawardsonsale has been trending on Twitter ever since the nominations list was announced. This is possibly because Akshay Kumar, who had three Rs 100 crore grossers this year, failed to make it even to the nomination list. His performance was appreciated across all quarters in Raja Krishna Menon's Airlift and Tinu Suresh Desai's Rustom . He also scored a blockbuster in Sajid-Farhad's Houseful 3 but either of these three films was not nominated.

Shahid Kapoor, Diljit Dosanjh and Kareena Kapoor Khan have been nominated in the Best Actor (Male), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Male) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Female) categories respectively. On the musical front, Udta Punjab has not only been nominated for the Best Music Album category but also Kanika Kapoor and Late Shiv Kumar Batalvi have been nominated for the songs Da Da Dasse and Ikk Kudi in the Best Playback Singer (Female) and Best Lyrics categories respectively.

The fact that two members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the mouthpiece of India's right-wing ideology, will be talking about its vision and ambitions has horrified many. So expect fireworks in this session and try to book a seat much in advance. A.N.D. Haksar, Alex Watson and Tim Whitmarsh in conversation with Arshia Sattar 
The theme of this session is atheism and the historical challenges it has faced since the classical era. Three formidable scholars of religion, who have an innate facility with language and an ability to decode complex theories in easily comprehensible language, are discussing this knotty topic. Expect lots of wry wit. Roberto Calasso in conversation with Devdutt Pattanaik  
Who but India's best-loved mythographer should be speaking with the man who's been described as a ""literary institution"" by The Paris Review ? Roberto Calasso will be talking about the Vedas and the Vedic people who lived in northern India more than 3,000 years ago. Mallika Dua in conversation with Suhel Seth  
If he's got sass, she's even sassier. This panel with the unstoppable and uncensorable Suhel Seth and India's Instagram Queen Mallika Dua will be a riot â we can predict this one from a mile. Luke Harding introduced by Samanth Subramanian

This would be her first Globe win after two previous losses for âEasy Aâ (2010) and âBirdman â (2014).

In second place is two-time Globe champ Annette Bening (â20th Century Womenâ) with 11/1 odds, thanks to the backing of one final expert: Thelma Adams (Gold Derby).

53,ARTE008SRC003,"Stars began arriving at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday for the Golden Globes, where speeches about Donald Trump and wins for the Los Angeles musical ""La La Land"" look like the night's surest things. 
Celebrities in slinky gowns and tuxes were met with brilliant sunshine - the clearest and warmest afternoon in LA in many days. Rains that have soaked much of California and might have dampened Sunday's festivities are now not expected to arrive until hours after the show is over. 
After recent terrorist truck attacks in Europe and Friday's airport shooting in Florida, the security provided by the Beverly Hills Police Department is heavier than ever. Long lines of police SUVs and officers on foot created a tight seal around the Beverly Hilton Hotel. 
Jimmy Fallon will emcee this year's show, to be broadcast live from Beverly Hills, California, by NBC at 8 p.m. EST. Fallon will start the show with a cold open of an ode to ""La La Land."" In a version of the film's opening number, where Angelenos stuck in a traffic jam dance on the freeway, Fallon leads a similar routine with limos and the red carpet. 
It's the first time in nearly a decade that someone other than Ricky Gervais or the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler is hosting the Globes, which is put on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But another transition is on the minds of many attendees. 
Though usually a boisterous, boozy affair, the coming inauguration of Donald Trump is looming over this year's Globes, which take place 12 days before the president-elect is to be sworn in. 
""The Globes have changed quite a bit. Everyone used to be drunk. Now I'm the only one who's drunk,"" joked Hugh Grant. 
Throughout the usual self-congratulatory toasting of Hollywood's awards season, many stars and filmmakers have evoked a foreboding sense of dread over a Trump presidency. Fallon, the popular ""Tonight Show"" host, isn't known for his political humor, but he has promised a steady diet of Trump jokes. 
Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" comes in with a leading seven nods and a seemingly lock on the best picture award for a musical or comedy. Its stiffest Academy Awards competition, Barry Jenkins' coming-of-age tale ""Moonlight"" and Kenneth Lonergan's family drama ""Manchester by the Sea,"" will square off in the Globes' dramatic categories, along with the heist thriller ""Hell or High Water,"" the Dev Patel-led ""Lion"" and Mel Gibson's ""Hacksaw Ridge."" 
""The People v. O.J. Simpson"" leads the television nominees with five nominations, including nods for stars Sarah Paulson, Courtney B. Vance, Sterling K. Brown and John Travolta. A number of recent shows are also in the mix, including ""Atlanta,"" ''Westworld,"" ''The Night Of,"" ''This Is Us"" and ""Insecure."" 
Last year's ceremony, hosted by Gervais, drew 18.5 million viewers, down about 4 percent from the year before. Among the presenters on tap for Sunday night's show are Leonardo DiCaprio, Emma Stone, Ben and Casey Affleck, Viola Davis, Amy Schumer, Sting and Matt Damon. 
Surely many attendees will be thinking of those absent. After a year full of notable deaths, the back-to-back passing over the holidays of Debbie Reynolds and her daughter Carrie Fisher was felt acutely in a Hollywood that revered both. Reynolds and Fisher were laid to rest Friday in Los Angeles. 
One other thing is assured: Meryl Streep will go home with an award. Though always a good bet for hardware, Streep is this year's recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for career achievement. She's also nominated for her performance in ""Florence Foster Jenkins,"" her 30th Globe nod.

57,ARTE010SRC001," For five months, the team at Madame Tussauds has been quietly prodding, polishing and painting the face of the 45th President of the United States. 
This is President-elect Donald Trump as you have never seen him before: up close and personal and made entirely of wax. 
Created by Madame Tussauds, the waxwork is one of four being made in London. Three others have already been shipped to Washington DC, New York and Orlando to coincide with Trump's inauguration on Friday. 

For the team behind the artwork, it's been a labor of love. 
""I was lucky enough to get some measurements from a sitting we had in 1997 at the Trump towers,"" chief sculptor David Gardner told CNN. 
""At the sitting we would take the measurement of the head and we would also use anchor points."" 

Gardner said seeing recent photos and videos of Trump in the media made it more exciting for him to sculpt the President-elect's model. 
""He made my job slightly easier because of his character. It was almost as far as doing a caricature and bringing it back,"" said Gardner. 
But the waxwork presented the team with some new challenges. 
His golden coif -- perhaps his most famous feature -- required some research, which involved calling the stylist from ""The Apprentice"". 
""We did a lot of research about how he styles his hair. It's hairspray and almost like a lacquer,"" explained Gardner. 
Capturing Trump's character 
Styling the waxwork's head of hair wasn't the biggest concern, it was the color. 
""His hair is a mixture of human hair and yak hair. We use yak hair with people with white hair because human hair is not readily available,"" said hairstylist Kelly Cox. 
To get the exact look, the team used as many as four color samples and from there they inserted each strand of hair individually -- a process that took about four weeks. For the President-elect's eyebrows, the team used squirrel hair. 
Getting his tone right was also a challenge for coloring artist Verity Talbot whose palette is full of pink and magenta; an array of tones that she hopes will bring the President-elect to life. 
""We'll look at everything so we'll try and get every little capillary, every wrinkle, slight marks on the skin, any moles,"" said Talbot.

62,ARTE011SRC003,"Meryl Streep delivered an emotional and searing speech at the Golden Globes, in which she criticized Donald Trump for imitating a disabled reporter while campaigning to be president, saying it âgives permissionâ to others to do the same.
The actor was accepting the Cecil B DeMille award on the night, and she used her speech to speak about what she said was the âone performance this year that stunned [her]â, referring to when Trump mocked the New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski .
âThere was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart,â Streep said. âNot because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. 
âIt was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still canât get it out of my head because it wasnât it in a movie, it was real life.â
'Hidden Fences'? Golden Globes slip-up combines nominated film titles.
In front of a visibly stunned room of stars who are renowned for being boisterous at the Golden Globes, she went on to add that Trumpâs actions had legitimized bullying and that it could trickle down into peopleâs everyday lives.
âThis instinct to humiliate, when itâs modeled by someone in the public platform,â she said. âBy someone powerful, it filters down into everyoneâs life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing.
âDisrespect invites disrespect, violence invites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.â
She also called on the press to hold power to account, and said that the freedom of the press needed to be protected now more than ever.
Streep wasnât the only star to address Trump. Viola Davis, who won best support actress for her performance in Fences, spoke about the president-elect backstage and said his win is a reflection of America.
âI think that America in and of itself has been an affirmation, but I think that weâve fallen short a lot because there is no way that we can have anyone in office that is not an extension of our own belief system,â she said.
âSo the what does that say about us? And I think that if you answer that question I think that says it all.â

The city is teeming with Sikh devotees, some of whom have travelled from foreign shores to witness the celebrations. For locals, seeing foreigners sporting turbans and âkirpansâ is even more surprising when they hear some of them converse in Punjabi. The celebrations started on December 30, and will conclude on January 5.
Baba Mohinder Singh has come from Birmingham with over 300 sevadars for the occasion. About 150 women from England are volunteering their services in the daily langars. Most of them have taken a two-week leave from work to participate in the festivities. 
About 120 Sikhs from the US and Canada have come to Patna Saheb as a part of the Raj Khalsa Yatra organised by Sikh Dharma International to pay their tributes to Guru Gobind Singh. They took out a Prabhat Pheri on Monday evening.
The grand festival has given Bihar an opportunity to establish its image in the hospitality sectors at a global level. Most foreign nationals are happy with the arrangements made jointly by the Bihar government and Gurudwara management committee. Some of them are staying at the Gurudwara or at the tent cities while few have booked themselves into hotels. They said they received an even more cordial reception in Patna Saheb than in Punjab. A French woman, Barbara Stray, who is touring countries on her bicycle, learned about the Sikh festival and took a diversion to Patna from her original route to participate in it.
The grand finale celebrations of Prakash Parv that kicked off on January 3 also witnessed attendance from several dignitaries. Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, who was in the town on Monday, participated in the celebrations by paying his regards at the Takht Harimandir Sahib Gurudwara besides visiting the Bal Leela Gurudwara nearby. âI have come here to take the blessings of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. His life is an inspiration to everyone,â he told the media.
Former Punjab CM, Captain Amarinder Singh, too arrived in Patna on Monday to take part in the Sikh festival. PM Narendra Modi, Former PM Manmohan Singh, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and several other Union Ministers and Chief Ministers are expected to participate in the event.
Sources said more than 7.5 lakh devotees have visited the Takht Sri Harmandir Ji Saheb Gurudwara since Christmas. This is almost equal to the number of devotees visiting the Gurudwara in a year.

The Foundation Wednesday announced it would be instituting a new set of awards, called the Ramnath Goenka Changemaker Awards, for District Magistrates who are helping provide answers to some of Indiaâs most complex problems.

âIf the Ramnath Goenka Awards for Excellence in Journalism reinforce the values of Ramnath Goenka, the newspaper publisher, the Ramnath Goenka Changemaker Awards will be in tune with his vision of governance and social change. A vision that touched the Constituent Assembly debates of which he was a part, and his interventions in politics for equity and justice,â Viveck Goenka, Chairman and Managing Director of The Express Group, said.

 Details of the awards and the application process will soon be announced, he said.

The idea is to celebrate the ambassadors of good governance on the ground, enrich public discourse and acknowledge the crucial role played by these young bureaucrats in effecting change. District Magistrates who have worked on and helped introduce change in their districts, through innovative introduction or management or planning of schemes, ideas and projects will be rewarded and encouraged.

âThe Changemaker Awards will celebrate District Magistrates across India who have best scripted and/or implemented change in their districts. Change that has touched men, women and children; change that has improved life, literally, on the ground â brought about by officers, the genuine ambassadors of good governance,â Goenka said.

At a function in New Delhi on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will give away these awards across 28 categories for exceptional work in print, broadcast and online journalism in English, Hindi and regional languages.

The Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards, the biggest annual event in the Indian media calendar, was instituted by the Ramnath Goenka Foundation in 2005 to celebrate the legacy of the founder of The Indian Express Group. It recognises excellence in journalism and showcases outstanding contributions by individuals each year.

Vimal Kumar, General Manager at Speaking Tiger said they had ""unexpected sales"", despite facing several technical glitches in the aftermath of demonetisation. 

""Due to demonetisation we faced several problems since many a times card machines didn't work due to lack of signals. But, it has been an excellent experience, rather unexpected sales for Speaking Tiger. Our sales have almost doubled this year,"" he said. 

Some of the top sellers at the stall included 'Himalaya: Adventures, Meditations, Life' edited by Ruskin Bond and Namita Gokhale, and 'Murderer in Mahim' by Jerry Pinto among others.

All time children favourites like 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid', Roald Dahl, 'Tintin Series' and Sudha Murty, books by Salman Rushdie, classics, and books by Bollywood celebrities including Karan Johar's autobiography, 'An Unsuitable Boy' and Twinkle Khanna's 'Mrs Funnybones' were major business makers for the publishing house.

""There has been a good turnout in comparison to last year. The sales have increased around 15 per cent this year for us. Popular international titles have been a major draw.

Pan MacmMillan's stall at the fair was thronged by 

visitors looking for the latest Booker Prize winning ""The Sellout"" by Paul Beatty, besides 'Truth About Trump' by Michael D'antonio and books by Jefferey Archer. 

""The crowd is much more this time and we have seen around 20 pet cent increase in our sales. We did not face any problem due to demonetisation and everything was managed quite well,"" Ratna Joshi, Head of Marketing at Pan Macmillan, said. 

Their children range 'Priddy' for toddlers (0-5 years) and books from the Disney series, particularly 'Frozen' were picked up in huge numbers. 

Demonetisation seems to have worked in favour of Bloomsbury, that sold books like 'Harry Potter series', 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' by Vijay Lokapally and 'Silk Route' by Peter Frankopan, witnessing a ""35 per cent"" increase in sales from last year.

Renowned Hindustani classical vocalist Kishori Amonkar passed away here today after a brief illness. She was 84.

She passed away at her home in central Mumbai tonight, family sources said.
Born on April 10, 1932 here, Amonkar was recognised as one of the foremost singers in the Hindustani tradition and as an innovative exponent of the Jaipur gharana. A gharana is a community of musicians sharing a distinctive musical style.

Amonkar's mother was the well-known vocalist Mogubai Kurdikar, who trained under Alladiya Khan Saheb, the doyen of the Jaipur gharana.

While learning the finer points and techniques of the Jaipur gharana from her mother, Amonkar also developed her own personal style, which reflects the influence of other gharanas and was generally regarded as an individual variant of the Jaipur tradition.

Amonkar cultivated a deep understanding of her art, largely through extensive study of the ancient texts on music, and her repertoire was grand in its sweep.

She was known primarily for her skillful singing of classical khayal songs set in the traditional ragas of Hindustani music, but also performed the lighter classical thumri repertoire, bhajan, devotional songs and film music. Regardless of musical genre, her performances were marked by vitality and grace.

Throughout her career, however, Amonkar was both criticised and praised for her bending of the Jaipur tradition.

As she prioritised the expression of emotion in her music, she frequently departed from the gharana's conventions of rhythm, ornamentation, and broader musical structure in order to intensify the impact of the music.

She aimed to infuse the emotional appeal of the more popular styles into the comparatively rigid classical tradition.

Besides being a renowned musician, Amonkar was a popular speaker and traveled throughout India giving lectures, most notably on the theory of rasa (feelings, emotions) in music.

In recognition of her contribution to the arts, she received many awards, including the Padma Bhushan (1987) and Padma Vibhushan (2002), two of India's top civilian honours.

In 2010, she became a fellow of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the national academy of music, arts, and dance.

Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, in their condolence messages, described Amonkar as a doyen of classical music.",ARTS

I had to get every contour of the piece in those two instances. That taught me concentration. The guru needs to be this good, Amonkar had said in an interview to Indian Express in December 2016. 
Apart from training under her mother, Amonkar learnt music from Anwar Hussain Khan of Agra gharana, Anjanibai Malpekar of Bhendi Bazar gharana, Sharadchandra Arolkar of Gwalior gharana and Goas stalwart Balkrishnabuwa Parwatkar.

Vinod Khanna, the actor who was one of the biggest heartthrobs of Bollywood in the eighties, has passed away. He was 70. 
The actor died of cancer at a hospital this morning. 
""He passed away at 11.20 AM. It's a sad moment for us...We request you all (media) for privacy,"" the actor's brother Pramod Khanna told PTI . 
A few weeks ago, Khanna was taken to HN Reliance Foundation and Research Centre in Girgaon, ostensibly for severe dehydration. A photo of an ailing Khanna from the hospital with his family was doing the rounds on social media recently.

Khanna was also an active politician, and a Member of Parliament from Gurdaspur, Punjab. 
The sitting MP had won the seat four times.

91,ARTE021SRC002,"More than anything else, Kattappa killing Baahubali in the 2015 blockbuster Baahubali: The Beginning, has been the most asked question. While the cast have earlier tricked their fans with misleading answers, Baahubali himself solved the riddle during a promotional meet recently organised in Kochi.
Answering the conundrum, Prabhas said at the promotional event, ""Imagine Kattappa stabbing his enemy from the back. And what if he mistook Baahubali as Balladeva and stabbed him from behind? Or why wouldn't he have a solid reason to stab Baahubali?"" He laughed and further added, ""Anyways, let this question have its suspense at least until the movie releases.""

The actor also urged the critics to not give spoilers and ruin the suspense built by the team. The actor also expressed his concern over the break of the suspense after the first day of the release.
While the team is counting days for the big day, Rajamouli can certainly breathe a sigh of relief post the Sathyaraj issue.

92,ARTE021SRC003,"April 24, 2017 00:00 IST Updated: April 24, 2017 04:10 IST SS Rajamouliâs lavish epic could rejuvenate the lukewarm fortunes of the IMAX experience in India 
When it arrives in theatres this week, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion will become only the third Indian film to release in the IMAX format. Following Dhoom 3 (2013) and Bang Bang! (2014), thereâs been a long hiatus on part of the Indian filmmakers to showcase their films in IMAX theatres. However, SS Rajamouliâs incredibly lavish epic could well rejuvenate the lukewarm fortunes of the IMAX experience in India. 
Larger than life 
Reportedly filmed at a budget of over 200 crores, with outrageously large sets, grand war scenes, and extensive CGI work, Baahubali 2 appears tailor-made for IMAX. âFrom the first time I saw an IMAX film in a theatre in Hyderabad, I used to dream of making a film on the IMAX camera, and offer such a grand experience,â says Rajamouli. âI am a big fan of large screen entertainment and even my films are about larger than life stories and characters.â 
Although Rajamouliâs film hasnât been shot on an IMAX camera â which is exceptionally expensive to operate â it has been digitally re-mastered by IMAX using its proprietary technology. Walt Cho, Director of Marketing and Distribution for IMAX in Asia Pacific explains how IMAX is a part of the filmmaking process and vision from the very beginning: âWe offer an end-to-end solution and work closely with filmmakers or studios during the film development process, unlike standard cinema theatres that simply show the final product in halls.â 
IMAX films offer a better experience to movie lovers for a number of reasons and Cho insists that a larger screen size is probably the least of them. Although positioned initially as the largest screen experience â IMAX stands for Image Maximum â IMAX quickly realised the challenges of focusing only on the screen size. Not every auditorium, after all, is capable of hosting a 90-feet wide screen. Instead, the company has spent the last few years perfecting their proprietary technology and convincing cinema partners and filmmakers that the IMAX experience cannot be matched by standard theatres. 
Emphasis on quality 
âIâm not sure why people are hung up on size so much,â says Cho. âWe have a dual-projection system and our systems provide 60% more brightness, 30% more contrast, and better image saturation. Our technology is built from the ground up so the re-mastered image is also the highest quality you can get. The sound is also re-mixed. We offer an end-to-end solution by working with filmmakers from the beginning and create the experience that they want you to have.â 
In addition, IMAX closely controls the entire environment in which films are screened, including the design of the auditorium, and the dimensions and curvature of the screen. The proprietary sound system is designed to complement the richness of the image on the screen. In effect, image maximum, has evolved now to imply maximum experience. 
Rajamouli agrees that itâs not just about the size of the screen: âWe look at the aspect ratio, as well as the sound, and see how they work together to create a better experience.â Has Baahubali 2 been shot on an even more lavish scale to cater to the IMAX experience? Rajamouli insists thatâs the wrong question to ask. Effectively, the film is not a sequel. Itâs merely the second part of a story that could not be told in a single film. âItâs like your grandmother starts telling you a story and you fall asleep. Then when you wake up and ask her to continue the story, you donât ask her whether the story is going to be bigger. This film was part of one continuous development and everything was set right from the time we shot the first film.â 
IMAX has seen surprisingly slow growth in film-crazy India. âWe thought we would have a network of ten theatres when Dhoom 3 released three years ago. But itâs actually at ten now,â says Cho. In comparison, China is host to around 300 IMAX theatres. Russia has 50. A number of factors have contributed to IMAXâs difficulties in India. âItâs a chicken and egg problem. There are a number of variables that are out of our control, such as business permits and licences. But weâre being patient in finding the right partners while expanding. We believe thereâs a lot of potential, especially in Tier 3 and Tier 4 markets where IMAX thrives and can actually become a lifestyle choiceâ 
In April 2016, IMAX signed a five-theatre deal with INOX, a movie exhibition chain. The first of those theatres opened at R-City, Ghatkopar in Mumbai. The next one opens in Bangalore, followed by another in Delhi. Surprisingly, the northern region barely has an IMAX presence. The only IMAX theatre in the entire region is at PVR Logix, Noida which opened about a year ago. 
Further expansion will largely depend on how Indian films take to the IMAX experience. Cho believes that Rajamouli is a filmmaker who belongs to the tradition of grand filmmaking espoused by directors such as Christopher Nolan whose upcoming film Dunkirk has largely been shot on IMAX cameras. In a way, Baahubali 2 not only needs to answer why Katappa killed Baahubali, but also whether IMAX will enjoy a rosy future in India. 
(In Hyderabad, however, the large screen at Prasads is under renovation and is unlikely to be ready by April 28 for Baahubali -The Conclusionâs release) 
I am a big fan of large screen entertainment and even my films are about larger than life stories and characters. 
Pushing the limits 
For the forthcoming World War II drama âDunkirkâ, Christopher Nolanâs crew has used a 54-pound IMAX camera as a hand-held device to achieve a sense of disorientation the filmmaker read about in stories of the real Dunkirk evacuation. ",ARTS

96,BUSE002SRC001,"In the shadow of demonetisation and a violent anti-land acquisition protest in Bhangar, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government is to inaugurate the third edition of its annual two-day business summit on Friday that will see participation from 25 countries.
The authorities are yet to formally announce any list of Indian business captains who would grace the Bengal Global Business Summit, to be inaugurated by President Pranab Mukherjee.
In an effort to shed the state's investor-wary image and woo much-needed business capital, the state government had reached out to various parts of the country and even foreign countries in the lead up to the event, being held in the sprawling Milan Mela ground. 
Russia, China, South Korea, Norway, Germany, Poland, the UAE, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore are among the overseas nations to be represented at the mega business gathering - the first after Banerjee's Trinamool Congress won a second successive term in office by sweeping the assembly polls last year. 
The August 31 Supreme Court verdict ordering the return of farmland to the peasants from whom it had been taken for the Tata Motors' Nano project by the erstwhile Left Front government is another monumental development that happened in 2016.
According to state Finance, Commerce and Industries Minister Amit Mitra, there would be at least 3,000 delegates at the plenary session, including a strong presence from countries where manufacturing units are really strong.
In order to ensure a strong foreign imprint, the state government organised a series of interactive sessions last September on business opportunities in Bengal at Germany's Dusseldorf, Munich and Stuttgart.
Teams had also fanned out to China and Japan last October, and Italy in November. A Chinese delegation also came to Bengal in September.
In a departure from the previous two years, key central government figures, most notably Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, would be skipping the summit.
While Jaitley's absence is being linked to his preoccupation with the February 1 budget, the deteriorating relations between the BJP-led central government and the state's Trinamool Congress regime could be a prime reason.
In a desperate attempt to turn things around in terms of investment in Bengal, Chief Minister Banerjee, who has been vocal against the central government's decision to recall Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, has appealed to industrialists time and again to infuse money in the eastern state, to meet the huge demands for jobs. Banerjee also frequently tom-toms the state as a zone of ""industrial peace"" where not a ""single manday"" is lost due to industrial disputes.
However, such claims may have lost some sheen in view of the trouble earlier this week in South 24 Parganas district's Bhangar, where two lives were lost following violent clashes between villagers and the police over the state government's bid to acquire 16 acres of farmland for a power grid project. 
The protesting villagers stoned policemen, torched their vehicles, dug roads and felled trees to stop their entry into the villages, in a virtual re-run of events of 2006-2008 when the state was on the boil following intense anti-farmland acquisition stirs.
The fresh chapter of the summit would focus on boosting start-ups in the state. Earlier, Mitra said the state was working with IIM Calcutta and iSpirit, an NGO associated with start-ups, so that the state could help home-grown start-ups to take off.
The state government has identified 11 priority areas for attracting investment, such as transport, civil aviation, mining, power, medium and small-scale enterprises, IT and ITeS and infrastructure.
The sessions would include sector-wise discussions to project the possibilities and potential of Bengal in front of investors.
""We hope the summit will fetch a good amount of investments' proposals this year. The only flip side is the depressed mood of local and domestic industries since the Centre's decision to recall notes,"" an official said.
According to the state government, the 2015 summit had fetched investment proposals to the tune of Rs 2.43 lakh crore and the 2016 edition received over Rs 2.5 lakh crore of investment proposals.

Not quite. The third edition of Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS) beginning Friday , will see the introduction of silent seminars in the city, with the speaker being heard only by those who wish to listen to the person. 

The state-of-the-art Microsoft technology requires the audience to wear headphones to tune into a particular frequency to listen to one seminar speaker. If the person wishes to attend another seminar, all they have to do is simply change the frequency without moving an inch. Between 9.30 and 11 on Saturday morning, 11 seminars will be simultaneously held at the four permanent halls in Milan Mela. Altogether, 16 seminars are slated du ring the two-day event. 

""Sound-proof walls or physical barriers will not be used between the various seminar zones. The demarcations will be done using potted plants. If a person were to walk in without a headphone into one of the halls where multiple seminars are underway , all that the person is likely to hear are the faint whispers of the speakers,"" said a member of the organising committee. 

The main plenary hall spread over nearly 50,000 sq ft can accommodate nearly 3,000 people. At the head of the giant hall will be a 100 ft long stage. Watchout technology will be in use for all digital content. The large digital screen can be used as a single screen or split into two or three screens displaying different content. 

Two VIP lounges, including a 25 m diameter dome, has been set up. The latter will be used to host President Pranab Mukherjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other important dignitaries. After sunset, projections will be done on the outer surface of dome, turning it into an installation piece in the ground. 

""We wanted to break the geometry of squares and rectangles, which people are used to seeing at fair grounds and seminar halls. Hence the dome christened stratosphere,"" the official said. 

An exhibition hall has also been set up where companies from Russia and Poland will exhibit their products.

Jaitley was scheduled to attend the event, but he was believed to have been asked by the party high command to stay away, according to sources.

102,BUSE004SRC001,"BP Plc, Europe's third-biggest oil company, has received government approval to set up petrol pumps to retail petrol and diesel in India.

BP will be the tenth player to enter the lucrative fuel retailing business that is seeing double digit growth, not seen anywhere in the world.

The UK-based firm, as also Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, was given approval by the Oil Ministry to retail petrol and diesel just a few days back, sources said.

When contacted, a BP India spokesperson said: ""BP sees a strong future for transportation fuels in India. We are keen to be involved in this market and contribute to its development."" The company had in January this year won in-principle approval to retail aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to airlines in India. A few months later, it got full approval for that.

Now, the company has also got permission for retailing petrol and diesel.

""We can confirm we have been granted approval for marketing for ATF and have additionally applied for an authorisation to market MS (petrol) and HSD (diesel),"" the BP spokesperson said.

For a licence to retail auto fuels petrol, diesel and ATF, a company should have invested a minimum of Rs 2,000 crore in exploration or production of oil and gas, oil refining, gas or product pipeline or terminals leading to additionality to the existing assets or creation of new assets in the eligible activities.

BP, which had in 2011 bought 30 per cent interest in 21 exploration blocks of Reliance Industries for USD 7.2 billion, had cited investment of nearly USD 500 million in oil and gas exploration and production for gaining the licence.

India currently has about 56,190 petrol pumps, with public sector firms operating a majority of them.

Private sector operators are limited to Essar Oil and Reliance Industries, which between them have some 3,500 petrol pumps. Royal Dutch Shell operates 82 petrol stations.

Numaligarh Refineries Ltd (NRL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) are late entrants and have six outlets between them.

State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) owns 25,363 petrol pumps, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) 13,802 stations and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) 13,439 outlets.

Kolkata-based Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) was the latest company to get fuel retailing rights and BP now is the 10th player in the arena.

In ATF or jet fuel retailing, there are 205 aviation fuel stations, 100 of which are owned by IOC, 40 by BPCL and 37 by HPCL. RIL has 27 aviation fuel stations at airports while joint venture of Shell and MRPL owns one.

103,BUSE004SRC002,"NEW DELHI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Global oil major BP plans to open up to 3,500 fuel stations in India, becoming the second overseas firm drawn to rising demand for gasoil and gasoline in the world's fastest growing major economy.

BP will join European oil major RoyalDutch Shell as the only foreign firms selling fuel in the country, challenging the market share of state refiners that control 93 percent of India's more than 56,000 outlets.

An oil ministry official told Reuters BP would be issued permission to set up the stations by Monday. A BP India spokeswoman confirmed the company had applied for a license to set up the fuel stations.

India is replacing China as the driver of global oil demand growth as its economy expands and a rising middle class buys motor vehicles. The International Energy Agency expects India to account for a quarter of global energy use by 2040.

""There is space for everybody as our fuel demand is growing,"" said M.K. Surana, chairman of state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp, adding that the entry of new players will make the retail market more competitive.

""State refiners will have to adopt novel ways to boost sales and retain their market share,"" added Surana, whose firm signed a deal this week to sell milk products at its retail outlets to attract customers.

India ended control over gasoline prices in 2010 and on diesel in 2014, making retail fuel attractive for private players like Essar Oil and Reliance Industries which are expanding their retail presence.

India recently allowed private firm Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd to see up fuel stations.

BP pulled out of a refinery and marketing joint venture with HPCL in 2006, when retail prices were way below market rates and federal financial support was given only to state firms.

""It is highly unlikely that India will revert to the subsidies regime, more so because of low oil prices. This strengthens the confidence of new players to enter the Indian fuel market,"" said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Singapore based consultancy Ivy Global.

Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in June that global oil majors including Saudi Aramco and Total planned to tap the retail fuel market in India.

Indian fuel markets could be a lucrative prize for BP, which reported a 45 percent drop in second-quarter earnings. It has also received an Indian licence for jet fuel sales.

It is not clear where BP will source fuels for local sales. India's pricing formula gives higher profits to retailers with refining plants or domestic supply sources.

""BP already has a tie up with Reliance on the gas side so there is a possibility they may strengthen this relationship further to the downstream side of the business,"" said Bansal.

BP in 2011 acquired a 30 percent stake from Reliance in some exploration blocks and formed a gas sourcing and marketing tie-up with the Indian conglomerate. Reliance operates the world's biggest refining complex in western India, but controls only a small share of retail fuel markets.

""Any refining or product sale tie-up with BP will suit Reliance which recently decided to exit from the African market, leaving it to explore new geographies and clients for its fuel,"" Bansal said.",BUSINESS

India's pricing formula gives higher profits to retailers with refining plants or domestic supply sources.""BP already has a tie up with Reliance on the gas side so there is a possibility they may strengthen this relationship further to the downstream side of the business,"" said Tushar Tarun Bansal, director at Singapore based consultancy Ivy Global.BP in 2011 acquired a 30 percent stake from Reliance Industries in some exploration blocks and formed a gas sourcing and marketing tie-up with the Indian conglomerate.

""Any refining or product sale tie-up with BP will suit Reliance which recently decided to exit from the African market, leaving it to explore new geographies and clients for its fuel,"" Bansal said.Reliance, owner of the world's biggest refining complex, currently has a small share in the local fuel market. Bansal said BP's entry into retail fuel sales may not immediately dent state refiners' market share as rising Indian fuel demand has the potential to absorb a new player.

117,BUSE009SRC001,"Passengers from a dozen or so countries will no longer be allowed to carry most electronic devices on flights to and from the United States, Reuters reported Monday, citing an unnamed official. One airline based in the Middle East had tweeted about the rule earlier on Monday, but later deleted the tweet.
Royal Jordanian tweeted on Monday around noon eastern time that, âfollowing instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabin is strictly prohibited.â The statement went on to say that the ban would exclude cellular phones and medical devices, and that the rule would go into effect on Tuesday. The airline also posted the statement on Facebook and replied to several comments from users on both social networks regarding the rule. The airline deleted the tweet and Facebook post hours later. 
Passengers on certain airlines will no longer be allowed to carry most electronic devices in flight cabins, according to reports. The airline Royal Jordanian announced the rule on March 20 in since-deleted Facebook and Twitter posts. 
Prior to the Reuters report, representatives for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told Newsweek to direct its inquiry to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, though a TSA representative acknowledged the agency was aware of the Royal Jordanian tweet. 
In an emailed statement, David Lapan, acting deputy assistant secretary in the office of public affairs at Homeland Security said, âWe have no comment on potential security precautions, but will provide an update as appropriate.â 
CNNâs aviation editor John Ostrower also reported on Monday about the electronics ban, writing for CNN Money that airlines from certain countries in the Middle East and Africa traveling to the U.S. would require passengers to check most electronic devices. Ostrower cited an unnamed U.S. official. More than a dozen airlines were expected to implement the rule, according to the report. 
For airport security to increase its focus on electronics at certain times is not unusual, according to Jeff Price, an aerospace science professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver and owner of Leading Edge Strategies, an airport management training company. The United Kingdom reportedly implemented a similar electronics ban after the liquid-bomb plot of 2006 . In that case, electronics were thought to be the planned detonators of the bombs. âWeâve seen it before and usually itâs in response to a potential threat that intelligence agencies have basically caught wind of, and itâs usually for a short period of time,â Price says. He adds that such bans tend to lead to more baggage and electronics theft by airport employees. 
On Monday evening, Royal Jordanian tweeted that it would release more information soon about the electronics ban, and Saudi Airlines issued a disclaimer for people traveling to the U.S. with portable computers and tablets.

118,BUSE009SRC002,"The U.S. government is temporarily barring passengers on certain flights originating in eight other countries from bringing laptops, iPads, cameras and most other electronics in carry-on luggage starting Tuesday. 
The reason for the ban was not immediately clear. U.S. security officials would not comment. The ban was revealed Monday in statements from Royal Jordanian Airlines and the official news agency of Saudi Arabia. 
A U.S. official told The Associated Press the ban will apply to nonstop flights to the U.S. from 10 international airports serving the cities of Cairo in Egypt; Amman in Jordan; Kuwait City in Kuwait; Casablanca in Morocco; Doha in Qatar; Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia; Istanbul in Turkey; and Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The ban was indefinite, said the official. 
A second U.S. official said the ban will affect nine airlines in total, and the Transportation Security Administration will inform the affected airlines at 3 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday. 
The officials were not authorized to disclose the details of the ban ahead of a public announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Royal Jordanian said cellphones and medical devices were excluded from the ban. Everything else, the airline said, would need to be packed in checked luggage. Royal Jordanian said the electronics ban affects its flights to New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal. 
David Lapan, a spokesman for Homeland Security Department, declined to comment. The Transportation Security Administration, part of Homeland Security, also declined to comment. 
A U.S. government official said such a ban has been considered for several weeks. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the internal security discussions by the federal government. 
Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly phoned lawmakers over the weekend to brief them on aviation security issues that have prompted the impending electronics ban, according a congressional aide briefed on the discussion. The aide was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The ban would begin just before WednesdayÂs meeting of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group in Washington. A number of top Arab officials were expected to attend the State Department gathering. It was unclear whether their travel plans were related to any increased worry about security threats. 
Brian Jenkins, an aviation-security expert at the Rand Corp., said the nature of the security measure suggested that it was driven by intelligence of a possible attack. He added that there could be concern about inadequate passenger screening or even conspiracies involving insiders Â airport or airline employees Â in some countries. 
Another aviation-security expert, professor Jeffrey Price of Metropolitan State University of Denver, said there were disadvantages to having everyone put their electronics in checked baggage. Thefts from baggage would skyrocket, as when Britain tried a similar ban in 2006, he said, and some laptops have batteries that can catch fire Â an event easier to detect in the cabin than in the cargo hold. 
Most major airports in the United States have a computer tomography or CT scanner for checked baggage, which creates a detailed picture of a bagÂs contents. They can warn an operator of potentially dangerous material, and may provide better security than the X-ray machines used to screen passengers and their carry-on bags. All checked baggage must be screened for explosives.

Royal Jordanian said all such devices - including laptops, tablets, cameras, DVD players and electronic games - would need to be checked in under new US government rules coming into force March 21. 
Only cell phones and medical devices needed in flight would be excluded from the ban, it said. The tweet was later removed amid suggestions the airline had released the information prematurely. 
CNN quoted a US official as saying the ban was believed to be related to a threat posed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. 
In a statement, the US Department of Homeland Security said: ""We have no comment on potential security precautions, but will provide an update when appropriate."" 
According to the Financial Times, which cited a US official, the new rules will concern eight Middle Eastern nations, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
The Guardian said the edict, distributed in a confidential email from the US Transportation Safety Administration, would affect 13 nations. 
The move would mark the latest attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to tighten security at US borders, after its bid to curb travel from a group of Muslim majority nations was twice blocked by the courts.

121,BUSE010SRC002,"Leading private equity firm Everstone Group, along with Singapore-based Sunrise BPO, has agreed to acquire the US-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions provider C3 (CustomerContactChannels) for around $150 million.

The acquisition, the first by India and South Asia- focussed Everstone in the US, is being done through Everise Services, a Singapore-based company held by Everstone, along with Sunrise BPO as a co-investor, Everstone said in a statement.

Though the company did not share the deal size, market sources told PTI that the deal was closed for USD 150 million for the Connecticut-based company.

They are acquiring 100 per cent shares held by Stone Point Capital, a private equity fund chaired by Stephen Friedman, who was a former chairman of Goldman Sachs, and also from the original promoters of C3.

Everise plans to more than double the revenue of C3, established in 2010, to $500-plus million over the next five years. It had reported a revenue of around $200 million in 2015. C3 is also present in the Philippines and Guatemala.

Under the agreement, Sunrise will lead the business operations apart from bringing in capital, while Everstone will be the largest investor and handle C3âs India operations.

The new management appointed Sudhir Agarwal as the global CEO of C3.

This is Everstoneâs third investment through its latest private equity fund, ECP III, which raised $730 million last year, and the second investment in the ITeS-enabled space after it acquired Servion Global Solutions, which is into customer engagement management, in 2014.",BUSINESS

The company that has presence in Philippines and Guatemala earns around $200 million in revenues. Everstone bought C3 from Stone Point, which was an investor in C3 through its private equity fund Trident V LP. It was a direct deal between Everstone and Stone Point, according to sources.âThe chairman of Stone Point is Stephan Friedman, formerly a Goldman Sachs chairman.So the Everstone management was confident about the pedigree of C3,â said a person aware of the discussions, who did not wish to be named. âEverise plans to make C3 into a US$500-plus million revenue company in the next five years,â Everstone said in the release.

Industry analysts expect this consolidation in the CRM space to continue growing further. âFrom a BPO perspective, with the integration of technology and BPOs increasing, this kind of a deal makes sense,â said an industry analyst who did not wish to be named.âBPOs are likely therefore, to invest in either a productised offering that can provide a strategic advantage, or links seamlessly with the existing solution. A niche provider who is providing only CRM (such as C3), it makes business sense because the particular technology adds on a complementary capability to something they (Sunrise) already have,â the analyst added.In 2014, Everstone acquired Servion Global Solutions , a leading Customer Engagement Management firm. âThe space has tagged room for growth, and the deal also shows that even though Everstone is majorly India and South East Asia focused, it is now looking outwards,â said the person quoted above.",BUSINESS

Ratan Tata-backed Moglix, a B2B e-commerce platform specialising in procurement of industrial products, has raised Rs. 28 crore in Series A funding led by Accel Partners. Jungle Ventures along with SeedPlus also participated in the round. With this the company has set a revenue target of $100 million (Rs 670 crore) over the next three years.

The company had in February this year raised an undisclosed amount from Tata, who is also a special advisor in Jungle Ventures and Accel Partners.

With the new round, Moglix has also roped in Anurag Srivastava, Founding and Managing Partner of Jungle Ventures, on its advisory board. Anurag will work with Moglix on product management and devising technology strategy for large manufacturing houses in the automotive industry.

Moglix, which caters to over 20,000 SME buyers and 100 large manufacturing houses through their platforms, said it will use the funds to expand its operational footprint across major industrial hubs in the eastern and southern markets. It also plans to increase its SME customer base by over five times to 100,000 and large manufacturing buyers to 1,000+ in the next 18 months.

Moglix recently expanded its operations in the West with the launch of its Pune office to cater to manufacturing companies in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Rahul Garg, CEO & Founder, Moglix, told BusinessLine that the B2B segment in India presents a great opportunity in a $300-billion dollar organised and fragmented market. ""We are working towards creating a platform where buying and selling is done efficiently in a transparent way. B2B procurement is waiting for a disruption.""

He further added that besides industrial supplies, it is playing an important role in facilitating online convenience and enabling supply chain efficiencies in business purchasing. The company, he said, is witnessing rapid growth and has partnered with 1,500+ manufacturers and distributors in India, China and Taiwan.

Moglix currently has more than lakh SKUs listed on the platform and serves some of the largest auto, electrical and PSUs in the country including Lumax, IndiaForge and Indian Oil. Recently, Moglix became part of the SAP start-up studio programme and is working closely with SAP on driving digital acceleration within manufacturing companies.

Garg added, Most manufacturing industries in India have remained low on technology adoption whether it is ERP, procurement, planning, inventory management, etc. The Make in India programme when combined with the digital initiatives in the country have great potential to play a transformative role in Indias manufacturing sector. We believe that technology can be a strong factor in propelling efficiency and scale for both procurement and sales of the organisations. We are working with many of these companies to fast forward them to the digital age where technology can enable them to do tasks 3-5X faster.

Speaking on the investment, Subrata Mitra, Partner, Accel Partners said, Currently medium and large enterprises procure from thousands of vendors, and the entire process is run on an ad-hoc basis.

Reliance, which was reluctant to disclose the equity structure or production plans, said the joint venture, called Dassault Reliance Aerospace, would be a ""key player"" in the execution of offset contracts as part of the fighter jet deal.

Last month, India and France had signed an agreement for 36 Rafale fighter jets, valued at 7.87 billion euros, or about Rs 59,000 crore.

Sources said the joint venture was likely to be in the ratio of 51:49, with Reliance owning a majority.

There was a strong push for a similar deal between Dassault Aviation and state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which the French company was believed to be resisting.

Dassault ultimately settled for Reliance Aerospace floated by Anil's Reliance Infrastructure, share prices of which rose 8.44 per cent on the BSE today on the news of the deal.

The agreement includes a 50 per cent offset obligation, the largest in the history of India.

The main feature of the offset agreement is 74 per cent of it has to be imported from India, which means direct business worth around Rs 22,000 crore.

The proposed partnership between Dassault and Reliance will also focus on promoting research and development projects under the indigenously designed, developed and manufactured programme.

Eric Trappier, chairman & CEO of Dassault Aviation, said, ""The formation of this joint venture illustrates our strong commitment to establish ourselves in India and to develop strategic industrial partnerships.""

Anil Ambani has also set up a separate joint venture between Reliance Defence and Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to manufacture air-to-air missiles.

India has recently brought in a policy which says the country will buy weapons designed in India with at least 40 per cent local content or systems designed abroad with at least 60 per cent indigenous content.

India has been looking to leverage its defence purchases to build a sophisticated arms industry. Defence forces are expected to spend around $100 billion in imports over the next five years. This year, around 89 per cent, or Rs 66,459.43 crore, of the total defence spending has been kept aside for capital acquisitions and modernisation of equipment.

""This is a transformational moment for the Indian aerospace sector and Reliance Infrastructure's subsidiary Reliance Aerospace,"" Anil Ambani, chairman of the Reliance group, said.

India, the worldâs largest arms importer, requires foreign defense companies to invest a percentage of the value of deals that they have been awarded into India to help the country build its own manufacturing base and wean itself off imports.

Dassault agreed to invest 50 per cent in so-called offsets of the $8.7 billion deal it signed with New Delhi on September 23 to supply 36 of its Rafale fighter jets. Reliance said the offset contract is Indiaâs biggest ever.

Billionaire Anil Ambani, whose Reliance has virtually no experience of defense manufacturing, hopes to turn his company into a major defense firm over the coming years.

The agreement with Dassault is a bet that Reliance can build manufacturing facilities at a site in the central Indian city of Nagpur to feed into Dassaultâs supply chain, or for future Indian government orders of the Rafale jet.

A person familiar with the agreement said part of the INR300 billion in offsets would be spent directly on Reliance manufactured products, and part would be spent through other Indian manufacturers, depending on which company could best carry out the work. The person was not authorised to speak to the media about the agreement and so declined to be identified.

Earlier this month, a female former engineer at Uber said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers at the company had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances, and even threatened her with a poor performance review.
The allegations, by Susan Fowler, highlighted the long-standing problem of gender discrimination in the technology industry.
Uber last week hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct a review of the claims, and Chief Executive Travis Kalanick called the allegations by Fowler ""abhorrent and against everything Uberstands for and believes in"".
Kalanick on Monday asked Senior Vice President of Engineering Amit Singhal to resign after technology news website Recode informed Uber of the previous sexual harassment allegation, the Uberspokeswoman said. Recode was the first to report Singhal's departure on Monday.
Singhal, who was hired in January, did not disclose the allegations when Uber hired him, nor were they revealed by reference checks, the Uber spokeswoman said.
Singhal did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In a statement to Recode he denied the allegation of harassment but acknowledged a dispute with Google.
""Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior,"" Singhal wrote to Recode. ""In my 20-year career, I've never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.""

It seems like Xiaomi opted to announce only one smartphone in India, the Redmi 4A, and weâre quite familiar with this smartphone considering that it originally launched back in November last year in China, read on. 
First and foremost, it is worth noting that Xiaomi manufactures 95% of devices they sell in India, in the country, so they only import 5% of them, at least thatâs what Xiaomi said at the launch event. That being said, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is a budget smartphone, and itâs identical to the phone that was announced back in November in China.

The device sports a 5-inch 720p (1280 x 720) IPS display, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable internal storage. Qualcommâs Snapdragon 425 64-bit quad-core SoC fuels this smartphone, along with the Adreno 308 GPU for graphics rendering. A 13-megapixel snapper (f/2.2 aperture, PDAF) can be found on the back of this phone, and a 5-megapixel shooter (f/2.2 aperture) is available on its front side. A 3,120mAh battery is also a part of this package, and should be more than enough for this smartphone, having its display and SoC in mind. 
Android 6.0 Marshmallow comes pre-installed on the Redmi 4A, and on top of it, youâre getting Xiaomiâs MIUI 8 OS, of course. This phone ships with an IR blaster, and also offer 4G LTE connectivity. The Redmi 4A measures 139.5 x 70.4 x 8.5mm, while it weighs 131.5 grams. The device comes in Gold, Gray and Rose Gold color variants, while it is priced at Rs. 5,999 ($92) in India.

192,BUSE034SRC001,"Infosys' N R Narayana Murthy said today that the compensation hike to Chief Operating Officer (COO) U B Pravin Rao approved by the board in February was not ""proper"" and ""will likely erode the trust and faith of the employees in the management and the board"". 

""The impact of such a decision (compensation hike) will likely erode the trust and faith of the employees in the management and the board,"" he said in an email to PTI here. 

Murthy also said that given the current poor governance standards at Infosys, the targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favor a top management person. 

""Finally, given the current poor governance standards at Infosys, let us also remember that these targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favor a top management person,"" he said. 

Murthy said giving nearly 60 per cent to 70 per cent increase in compensation for a top level person (even including performance-based variable pay) when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6-8 per cent is improper. 

""Giving nearly 60% to 70% increase in compensation for a top level person (even including performance-based variable pay) when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6% to 8% is, in my opinion, not proper,"" he said. 

This is grossly unfair to the majority of the Infosys employees including project managers, delivery managers, analysts, programmers, sales people in the field, entry level engineers, clerks and office boys who are toiling hard to make the company better, Murthy said. 

""With what conscience can a decent person like Pravin ( a man schooled in Infosys values for over 30 years) tell his juniors that they should work hard and make sacrifice to reduce cost and protect margin? I have got so many mails from these people asking whether this resolution is fair. No previous resolution in the history of the company has received such a low approval,"" he added. 

Murthy, however, said he has lots of affection for Pravin. ""I recruited Pravin in 1985 and had nurtured him throughout my stay at Infosys since then. He had been sidelined. He was not even a member of the Executive Council at Infosys in 2013 when I came back. Kris, Shibu and I encouraged him, elevated him to the board, and made him the COO when we recruited Vishal as the CEO. So, this abstention has nothing to do with Pravin,"" he said. 

""Those of us who have always stood for fairness in compensation and practised it, right from the day Infosys was founded, will have to demonstrate it when needed. This is a time when it is needed. Nothing more and nothing less,"" he wrote. 

Murthy said he always believed in striving towards reducing differences in compensation and equity in a corporation. 

""You may not know that my Infosys salary at the time of the founding of Infosys was just 10 per cent of my salary in my previous job. I ensured that my younger, co-founder colleagues got 20 per cent higher salary over their salaries in their previous job even though I was 7 levels above them in my previous job and was 11 years' older than them. 

""I gave them huge equity compensation the like of which has never been replicated in this world. So, this abstention comes from somebody who has walked the talk,"" he said. 

Murthy said he always felt that every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation and perquisites. And he or she has to fight for maintaining a reasonable ratio between the lowest salary and the highest salary in a corporation in a poor country like India. 

""The board has to create a climate of opinion for such a fairness by their actions,"" he added. 

""This is necessary if we have to make compassionate capitalism acceptable to a majority of Indians who are poor. Without compassionate capitalism, this country cannot create jobs and solve the problem of poverty. Experts tell me that capitalism may come to an end in the not-so-distant future if the current corporate leaders do not heed this advice in India,"" he said.(This

193,BUSE034SRC002,"NEW DELHI: Infosys today said its shareholders have approved the proposal to adopt a new Articles of Association (AoA), bringing in provisions for buyback of shares and appointment of independent directors. 

""The resolutions...have been passed by the members of the company with requisite majority. The approval is deemed to have been received on the last date of receipt of postal ballot forms March 31,"" Infosys said in a BSE filing. 

Shareholders also approved revision in compensation of Chief Operating Officer & Whole-time Director U B Pravin Rao , and also appointment of D N Prahlad as an Independent Director. 

In February, Infosys Board had approved pay hike of its Chief Operating Officer U B Pravin Rao. 

According to the new Articles of Association (AoA), Infosys ""may purchase its own equity shares or other securities by way of a buy-back arrangement."" 

Infosys, which has liquid assets worth Rs 35,697 crore (about $5.25 billion) on its books, has been under pressure from investors to utilise the amount either through share buyback or a generous dividend. 

The pressure has grown further after its industry peers Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services announced their buyback offers worth $3.4 billion (about Rs 22,652 crore) and Rs 16,000 crore, respectively. 

While there have been reports that Infosys may consider a Rs 12,000 crore share buyback, the company has maintained that it will take a decision at an ""appropriate time"". 

Besides, Infosys has inserted provisions related to issuance and allotment of convertible preference shares, cumulative preference shares and redeemable preference shares in the new AoA. 

While Article 13 relating to power of the Board to issue shares at a discount has been deleted from the new AoA, provisions relating to nomination facility for shares by a shareholder have been inserted. 

""An express provision has been made on the appointment of independent directors to be made on terms in accordance with the applicable law have been inserted,"" the company said. 

The provisions also said the company may appoint 15 directors and any increase beyond such limit will require special resolution in line with the Companies Act, 2013. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!",BUSINESS

A few days after truce was called between the Infosys board and its founders, N.R. Naryana Murthy on Sunday accused the company he founded of poor governance standards. In an email statement sent to select media houses, he said the compensation hike given to the Infosys Chief Operating Officer, U.B. Pravin Rao, was not proper. 
Mr. Murthy also alleged that the hefty hike to top management would likely erode the employeesâ faith in the management and the board. 
âGiving nearly [a] 60-70% increase in compensation for a top-level person, even including performance-based variable pay, when the compensation for most of the employees in the company was increased by just 6-8% is, in my opinion, not proper,â Mr. Murthy said in his email. 
âI have lots of affection for Pravin. Let me state you the facts. I recruited Pravin in 1985 and had nurtured him throughout my stay at Infosys,â he said.

Pointing to the board, Mr. Murthy said: âGiven the current poor governance standards at Infosys, let us also remember that these targets for variable pay may not be adhered to if the board wants to favour a top management person.â 
âI have always felt that every senior management person of an Indian corporation has to show self-restraint in his or her compensation and perquisites,â he wrote. 
Mr. Murthyâs letter comes after the company on Sunday published the results of e-voting by shareholders on decisions such as increasing the salary of Mr. Rao and the appointment of Mr. Prahlad. 
According to information filed to the stock exchange, about 32.54% shareholders voted against the decision to hike Mr. Raoâs salary. 
âNo previous resolution in the history of the company has received such a low approval,â stated Mr. Murthy. 
In February, the firmâs founders, led by Mr. Murthy, wrote to the board questioning governance issues in the company, the huge severance pay given to former CFO Rajiv Bansal, and the salary hike to CEO Vishal Sikka. Eventually, both parties agreed not to discuss such issues in public.",BUSINESS

Almost 24 hours after news broke out that Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel did not want to expand in poor countries such as India and Spain, its rating on the App Store dropped to a ""single starâ from âfive stars"", reported IANS . Users in India have been so miffed with this statement that #UninstalSnapchat and #BoycottSnapchat started trending on Twitter.
As on April 16, the ""Customer Ratings"" of the current version of the app on the App Store was ""single star"" (based on 6,099 ratings) and all versions rating was ""one and half star"" (based on 9,527 ratings).
According to a report published in Variety , the CEO, while discussing expansion plans in a meeting allegedly dismissed an employeeâs concern of the slow growth rate of the app in India, stating that the app was only meant for ârich peopleâ. According to ex-employee Anthony Pompliano, Spiegel stated during the meeting, âThis app is only for rich people. I donât want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.â
An estimated active user base of 150 million, it is one of the fastest growing social media platforms. An average snap chatter spends around 25-30 minutes on this app every day. Its inception created a buzz among the users of bracket 18 to 34 years which is no longer the case, as the app has transcended the age barrier over time.

197,BUSE036SRC003,"While Indians are increasingly downloading Snapchat on their smartphones, the companyâs CEO feels India is âtoo poorâ to seriously consider expanding its user base. 

According to a report by Variety , the disparaging comment was made by the CEO of Snapchat, Evan Spiegel , allegedly during a meeting to discuss the growth of the appâs user base in 2015. 

When an employee raised concern about the appâs slow growth in a market like India which has a growing mobile penetration, Spiegel cut the employee mid-sentence saying, âThis app is only for rich people,â Spiegel said, Variety quoted the employeeâs revelation. âI donât want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.â 

India is a rapidly growing market with Internet penetration expected to grow 2.5 times by 2020, with mobile leading the race. It is these numbers which are driving tech giants like Amazon and Uber and investors like Masayoshi Son and Jack Ma to invest billions of dollars in the country. 
Snapchat unredacted lawsuit by gmaddaus on Scribd 
The employee Anthony Pompliano , who is currently engaged in a lawsuit against Snapchat after he accused the company of misleading investors by providing inflated statistics about user data, said Spiegel stormed out of the meeting after making this comment. 

According to unverified reports, Snapchat had close to 4 million users in India last year. While though the exact user base is not available, this number is expected to have grown since then. In comparison, Whatsapp has close to 200 million users in India. 

The comment is part of the allegations made public on April 10, according to Variety, after Snapchat gave up on its efforts to keep the complaint redacted. Variety reports Pompliano , who was hired from Facebook to increase the companyâs user base, was fired by Snapchat later. 

The company has officially responded to this story and here is what the spokesperson shared: 

""This is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It's available worldwide to download for free."" 

Also, in the notice we filed with the court when we unsealed Pompliano's original complaint (attached), we wrote: 

""Snap did not give investors misstated user metrics back in 2015; nor did Snap employees commit any of the panoply of alleged bad acts that litter Pompliano's complaint. Snap will demonstrate as much at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum.""

Saturday night proved, yet again, that when it came to celebrations, women of Bengaluru had only two options: Stay indoors or join the revelry and get molested. 
Ahead of the celebrations, security had been beefed up at the epicentre of revelry  Brigade Road and MG Road. Cops were everywhere, to help the people, yet, there were only distraught, hapless women left, post the celebration. 
 
More than 60 CCTV cameras were strategically placed. A special task force was ready for any eventuality. There were metal detectors and barricades for the public on the Cauvery Emporium side as well as on the other end of Brigade Road near Rex Theatre, towards Residency Road. 
And despite all the preparations the crowd that came to celebrate seemed uncontrollable. 

Compared to the last two years, I found the crowd was thicker and at the stroke of midnight, all hell broke loose. Despite several attempts by the police to clear up the area near Cauvery junction, the wild revelry continued such that women and children had to turn to friends and family for protection. 
Screams for help started ringing in the air as people in dire straits were not able to reach the police as they were caught in a sea of revellers, many of whom were clearly drunk and out of control, and looking to misbehave. 

Once, crowd-control began, complaints started to pour in as many young women, some of them weeping, started to run towards women police officers to save them from the unruly mob. 
Though the police admitted that many were molested by unknown miscreants in the crowds, the victims themselves were not forthcoming â either too shocked by the incident or too intimidated to reveal themselves to the media. 
 
There were some Good Samaritans too who rushed to the police seeking help to save a few girls caught in the unruly crowd. I witnessed a girl being surrounded by 20-odd drunk revellers, determined to keep her trapped within their circle despite her cries. ",CRIME

Late on the night of February 26, filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt received a call from an unidentified caller, who claimed to be a gang leader, to extort a sum of Rs 50 lakh. The caller stated that if he is unable to fulfil his demand, he will kill his daughter Alia Bhatt and wife Soni Razdan. According to a report by India Today, Police registered an FIR late on Wednesday night and recorded a statement from Mahesh Bhattâs family. The case has now been transferred to Mumbai Policeâs Anti Extortion Cell (ANC) and the matter will be further investigated by them along with other Police departments. 
A source close to Mumbai police stated that after receiving the call, Mahesh Bhatt initially thought it to be a prank but later he received a number of texts and whatsapp messages that stated that these threats shouldnât be taken lightly. The caller said, if his instruction werenât followed heâll kill Alia Bhatt and Soni Razdan.

210,CRME005SRC001,"A 38-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting schoolgirls by trapping them by saying that he has been sent by their parents for giving them some items or others in east Delhi's New Ashok Nagar area, police said on Monday. 
Sunil Rastogi was arrested on Sunday on the basis of a tip-off, DCP(East) Omvir Singh said, and has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days on a Delhi court order. 
""The accused told police that he used to target minor girls. Whenever he would find any minor girl going to home from school, he used to mislead her on the pretext that her father had sent some clothes or some other articles to give her and take her to an isolated place,"" he added. 
The accused works as a tailor and is married with five children, including three girls, said another officer, adding that his daughters are being counselled to know whether he had also targeted them. 
On January 10, two cases of kidnapping were registered in New Ashok Nagar police station wherein complainants alleged a man misled their daughters, aged 10 and 9, said the officer. 
The accused allegedly took them on the stairs of a building and fled when they raised an alarm, he said. 
Earlier, on December 13 also, a case under sections 376 (Punishment for rape) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC and section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act was registered on the statement of a minor girl, said the officer. 
He said since all the three cases had a similar pattern, it was suspected that the same person was involved in all of them and investigations were taken up. 
""In all the three cases, victims were minors in the age group of 9-10 and it was also revealed that the accused first misled the minors by telling them that their father had given some clothes or articles for them and then he took them to isolated place where he allegedly tried to sexually assault them,"" said the officer. 
A team under inspector CR Meena, SHO, New Ashok Nagar police station, and ACP (Kalyanpuri) Rahul Alwal took up the investigation. 
CCTV footages from cameras installed near the places of incidents were obtained and some images of the accused were developed, said Singh. 
During interrogation, he confessed he committed the alleged offences and also revealed he committed similar offences with other girls in New Ashok Nagar, Delhi, Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh), and Rudrapur (Uttarakhand), said the officer. 
According to the DCP (east), OS Bishnoi, the accused has told them he Ã¢ÂÂtried to sexually assault 600 girlsÃ¢ÂÂ, The Indian Express reported. 
It has also been revealed from interrogation that many cases including under NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) and of theft and molestation were registered against the accused at various police stations in Rudrapur, Delhi and Ghaziabad. 
Rastogi is a permanent resident of Rampur in Uttar Pradesh and came to Delhi in 1990 with his family and left Delhi in 2004. 
""He resides in Rudrapur now. He studied up to fifth standard at government school in his village. He is being interrogated regarding other offences committed by him at different places,"" added the officer. ",CRIME
211,CRME005SRC002,"A tailor in India has confessed to abducting, molesting and raping ""hundreds"" of schoolgirls over the last decade, said Delhi police, uncovering what may be one of the biggest serial paedophile cases in the country in recent times.
Sunil Rastogi, a 38-year-old married man with five children, was arrested on Saturday by police investigating the sexual assault of three girls aged nine and ten in the east of Delhi.
""This criminal, Sunil Rastogi, is from Rudrapur in Uttar Pradesh, and is a tailor by profession,"" Omvir Singh Bishoi, East Delhi's deputy commissioner of police, told a news conference on Sunday.
""During interrogation he told us that at least once a week he would come from Rudrapur and, in order to satisfy his paedophile lust, he would target girls between the ages of seven and ten years old.""
Rastogi was charged with rape, aggravated penetrative sexual assault of a minor, and criminal intimidation, in the three cases, said police, and is also being investigated for related paedophile crimes.
Police said that Rastogi could not remember the exact number of girls he had sexually assaulted since 2004, but said it could be ""hundreds"".
Wearing a red, white and green striped sweater and a red balaclava covering his face, Rastogi was paraded in front of the media on Sunday.
""I used to take them (the girls) to a secluded area,"" he said as he stood handcuffed to a policeman. ""I don't know why I did it. I liked it.""
Child sex abuse is widespread in India, but is largely considered taboo in its conservative society and ignored within families, say activists, who say victims are often afraid to come forward for fear of being blamed for the abuse.
There were over 94,000 crimes committed against children in 2015, says the National Crime Records Bureau, with almost 40 percent of cases being sex offences such as rape, molestation and sexual harassment.
Police said they began investigating Rastogi in December after receiving a complaint of a 10-year-old girl who had escaped attempted rape in Delhi's New Ashok Nagar area.
Two similar complaints from other girls in the same area were received on Jan. 10, said police, and after scouring through hours of CCTV footage of the area, and using sketches and photographs to identify him, Rastogi was arrested.
Rastogi has been sent to judicial custody for two weeks, said police, and an investigation team will look into other sexual assault cases in Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
Activists and politicians questioned how Rastogi managed to abuse so many girls and evade arrest for over 10 years, despite having served jail time for a previous sexual offence in 2006.
Swati Maliwal, Head of Delhi's National Commission for Women, said the case was ""horrifying"".
""This serial rapist shud get death 4 raping 500 little girls over 13 years. His case shud be heard urgently in fast track mode,"" tweeted Maliwal.

Tamil actor Dhanush on Tuesday appeared before the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court in connection to a petition by an elderly couple, claiming the âKodiâ actor to be their biological son. The Court had earlier directed Dhanush to appear before it for verification of his birthmarks - a mole on his collar bone and a scar on his forearm, as claimed by the petitioners. 
After appearing before the court, Justice G Chockalingam directed the government doctors and the registrar of the High Court bench to authenticate his identification marks. The verification process was done in the registrar's chamber, and the case was adjourned to March 2 for final hearing. 
Kathiresan, 60 and Meenakshi, 55 had in November last year moved the Judicial Magistrate Court in Melur claiming that Dhanush was their biological son. They produced his birth certificate and some childhood photographs as evidence, and sought a monthly maintenance of Rs. 65,000 from the actor. 
Dhanush had then filed a petition in the High Court seeking to dismiss the proceedings initiated by the court in Melur. He stated that he was not their son and that it was a ploy to extract money from him. Dhanush also dismissed the presence of any such birthmarks as claimed by the couple. 
The couple claimed that Dhanushâs real name was Kaliselvan, and he was born at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on November 7, 1985. He is one of their three children, who did his schooling in RC Higher Secondary School and Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Melur. When he was admitted to a private institution for class 11 in Thirpuathur in Sivaganga district in 2002, he escaped from the school to Chennai to pursue a career in acting and rechristened himself as Dhanush K Raja. 
Dhanushâs counsel has provided his Class X education certificates and other necessary documents to prove that he did his schooling in Chennai. The actor's birth certificate produced before the court reveals that he was on July 28, 1983. 
The coupleâs lawyer claimed that the birth certificate was not genuine as it didnât carry his name. Further, it was issued 10 years after his birth. They questioned how a birth certificate could be issued after a decade of Dhanushâs birth, and still not carry his name. 
In addition, it was also stated that the name of the father in the birth certificate is Krishnamoorthy. And if the records are anything to go by, Krishnamoorthy changed his name to Kasturi Raja on February 18, 2015. 
But the actor clarified that his birth name R K Venkatesh Raja was changed to Dhanush K Raja in 2003. The coupeâs side said that the papers filed before the court clearly stated that his name was mentioned as Dhanush in in 2002.

216,CRME007SRC001,"THE FAMILY OF an Indian schoolgirl who died after observing a two-month fast has been charged with homicide amid allegations that she was coerced to undertake a controversial religious ritual Indian police have said.

13-year-old Aradhana Samdariya collapsed and fell into a coma two days after finishing a 68-day fast and later died of an apparent cardiac arrest in southern city Hyderabad on 4 October.

Investigating officer M Mattaiah told AFP that the girlâs parents and other family members were charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder over complaints by advocacy groups that she was coerced to fast in accordance with a Jain ritual.

âAs of now nothing is clear,â Mattaiah said. âThe body was cremated and our investigation will rely on the doctorâs report.â

Jainism is an ancient, nonviolent religion with more than four million followers, mostly from affluent trading communities, living in India.

According to her family, Samdariya had pledged to observe the 68-day long penance known as âChaturmasâ and over the marathon fasting period was only allowed to drink boiled water twice a day.

Massive celebrations were held after Samdariya completed the fast, with hundreds of community members and politicians attending the event, and taking selfies with her.

Her funeral was later attended by more than 600 people, where she was hailed as a âchild saintâ, with many celebrating her death.

Media reports said the family was advised by a priest to ask the girl to fast to bring prosperity to their business, which had recently slowed down.

Her grandfather, Manekchand Samdariya, refuted the allegations, saying they were traumatised over her death and she was fasting out of her own free will.

âIt was about her faith. No one forced her to fast. She fasted for 34 days in 2015 and eight days in 2014,â Samdariya told AFP.

219,CRME008SRC001,"Four Nigerian students sustained severe injuries after being attacked by a group of residents in Greater Noidaâs Pari Chowk area on Monday. The incident took place around 6 pm, when a group of over 100 locals held a protest at the busy junction demanding that all Africans living in residential colonies in Greater Noida be asked to vacate their rented houses immediately. 
This protest was organised after a Class 12 student in Greater Noidaâs NSG Black Cats Enclave died of a suspected drug overdose on Saturday and five Nigerian students living in the neighbourhood were booked for murder. The students were later released for lack of evidence. When the victim, Manish Khari, went missing on Friday evening, a rumour spread that the teenager had last been seen with a group of Nigerians. A crowd raided the home of these African students and, when they failed to find Khari, accused the Nigerians of having eaten them up. 
The police have registered a case for attempt to murder in Monfayâs violence and have arrested five people. âWe have identified many accused persons through video footage recorded by officers present at the venue,â said SP (Greater Noida-Rural) Sujata Singh. âMore arrests are likely.â 
According to police, the locals had permission to organise a peaceful protest at Pari Chowk on Monday, but the situation suddenly went out of control despite police officials being present. The crowd turned violent when they spotted some Nigerians near the site of the protest and attacked them. 
âThe injured persons were rushed to hospital and their conditions are stable now,â Singh said. 
According to Samuel Abiye Jack, president of the Association of African Students in India, todayâs incident was not an isolated case. Several attacks have taken place in localities close to Pari Chowk since Sunday night, and so far 10 African students, including those injured on Monday, have been targeted, he claimed. 
âThe students attacked today and in the other incidents reported in the past 24 hours were merely passing by when they were spotted by the locals,â he said. âAll cases are of unprovoked attack.â 
However, Sujata Singh of the Noida police denied reports of other complaints. âIf multiple incidents have happened, I urge the concerned victims to come and lodge complaints,â he said.

220,CRME008SRC002," When a Class 12 student went missing from a locality in Greater Noida on March 24, residents of the National Security Guards Black Cat Enclave allegedly barged into a flat of five Nigerian students in search of the missing boy. They first thing they did was to search their refrigerator. What were they looking for? Well, this time it wasn't beef, but human meat as the residents suspected the African students of cannibalism. They were searching for the remains of the deceased, Manish Singh. The next morning, Manish was found lying in a park nearby and later admitted to a private hospital, where he died on (March 25) due to cardiac arrest, caused allegedly due to drug overdose. It also couldn't get more ironical considering the age-old ties between India and Africa based on anti-racism and anti-colonialism, not to forget the growing bilateral relations with Africa.  But following a complaint by the deceased's family members, the Greater Noida police on March 26 booked the Nigerians in connection with the death. Although initial evidence suggested that the teenager overdosed on drugs, the police said they booked the African students on suspicion of drugging the 19-year-old. Following the incident, African students, led by the Association of African Students in India (AASI), staged protests outside the Greater Noida's Kasna police station, saying the five were wrongly framed. The police, on the other hand, assured the protesting students that they will take action only after investigating the matter. ""We have registered an FIR based on the complaints filed by victim's family members. As per our preliminary investigation, we have not found any previous history of victim's drug addiction. We have also not found any direct link between the victim and the accused. We are still investigating the matter,"" said Abhinandan, circle officer, Greater Noida I, was quoted as saying by The Times of India . When the clue to every crime is stored in a refrigerator Just like the scourge of Islamophobia, Afrophobia is another epidemic that has engulfed Indian cities for long. There have been a number of incidents in the recent past to safely conclude that the multi-layered prejudices of Indians against religious, sexual, gender and racial minorities are on full display. For the citizens of ""New India"" it's the ""others"" living amid them who are responsible for any misery that befalls them. Considering the times we are living in, it's actually not strange that Manish's neighbours went and raided the Nigerians' refrigerator as their first reaction.According to The Telegraph report, a resident of the enclave told TV channels yesterday: ""I have known Manish for nine years and he was a good boy studying for his 12th board exams. His mother Mamta told me that he had refused to talk to the Negroes when they waved to him two days before the incident. Recently, two dogs went missing. The Africans may have eaten them up."" ""They accused them of being cannibals. That is the kind of ignorance against black people,"" Samuel Jack, the president of the Association of African Students in India (AASI), was quoted as saying by told The Telegraph . Racial discrimination is just another manifestation of the various forms of violence in India as a result of the deep-entrenched prejudice that runs across caste, region, religion to gender. And just like the commonplace violence against minority groups, including women, sporadic incidents against âvulnerableâ people include frequent attacks on Africans living in India. From racial jokes to comments on their skin colour and being branded as ""drug-traffickers"", Africans living in Indian metro cities are often subjected to the worst forms of violence. Role of the government India, despite being a country with the largest diaspora communities, doesn't seem to be worried much. Because despite repeated attacks on Africans living in India, the official denial in the pastâ that such acts are not racially motivated â only shows the unwillingness to tackle the real problem and accept the fact that even racism exists in India. Following a spate of attacks on African nationals in India, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj last year had said, the incidents were âcriminal acts and not racial"". âThese were not premeditated acts against a particular community, rather these were spontaneous attacks perpetrated by anti-social and criminal elements,â she had said. The Indian government's ""non-committal"" position was also widely criticised in the backdrop of India-Africa Summit in 2015. It also couldn't get more ironical considering the age-old ties between India and Africa based on anti-racism and anti-colonialism, not to forget the growing bilateral relations with Africa in the fields of trade and technology. Notwithstanding the government's ""unwillingness"" to admit the scourge, there is certainly something more deeper and sinister at the heart of such bias â the great Indian mentality. We perhaps take too much pride in our culture and heritage that blinds us towards the human aspects of living in a society with different kinds of people. Indians perhaps can no longer tolerate the presence of the outsiders who ""invaded"" and ""polluted"" the Indian culture. But then perhaps the ""new India"" is too confident that it doesn't need anyone else, at least not anyone outside what they view as India and Indian-ness. The facade of a tolerant ""new India"" â a ""bhavya"" and ""divya"" Bharat â indeed seems to be crumbling fast. #Afrophobia , #Africans , #Indian ",CRIME

All the three accused were charged under IPC sections 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping), 302 (murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 203 (giving false information in respect of an offence) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence).

Additionally, Indrani and Sanjeev were charged under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) for plotting to kill her son and Sheena's brother Mikhail Bora.

Mikhail had earlier alleged that Indrani had spiked his drink on the same day when Sheena was killed.

Besides, Indrani was also charged under IPC section 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record).

Indrani, former media baron Peter and Sanjeev were present in the court today. They were sitting separately in the dock and were later seen chatting with their lawyers outside the court.

The CBI had on December 19 started arguments on framing of charges in the sensational Sheena Bora case, saying it was her relationship with Rahul, Peter's son from earlier marriage, that led to her murder.

Sheena was murdered on April 24, 2012, and her body was burnt and disposed of at a forest in Raigad district on the next day, according to the prosecution.

Indrani was arrested in connection with the case in August 2015.

Apart from Indrani, Peter, Sanjeev Khanna and her driver Shyamver Rai were also arrested in the case.

Rai had earlier turned approver in the case and disclosed to CBI how the crime was committed by the accused. 

The CBI had on December 19 last year started arguments on framing of charges in the sensational Sheena Bora case, saying it was her relationship with Rahul, Peter's son from earlier marriage, that led to her murder.

Special public prosecutors Bharat Badami and Kavita Patil had contended that the trouble started when the accused learnt that Rahul (Peter's son with first wife) and Sheena (Indrani's daughter from earlier relationship) were in a relationship.

""There was total and full support to Vidhie (daughter of Indrani and Khanna) and total disregard towards Sheena,"" Badami had argued.

He had also told Judge Mahajan that the I-T returns of Indrani between 2005-08 showed she gave more money to Vidhie than to Sheena.

The reason for the murder was property, he said, adding that CBI added a charge of forgery against the accused in connection with a suspicious sale of property in Delhi.

Indrani had a soft corner for Vidhie and was worried that if Rahul-Sheena marriage materialised, all Peter's property will go to Rahul, the prosecutor said.

Badami also said Peter was fully aware of the crime. He was Rahul's father, but he did not take any ""appreciable step"" over Rahul's concerns when Sheena went missing.

In one of her emails to Indrani, Sheena expressed her desire to marry Rahul and said she was happy and safe with him, the prosecutor said, adding ""it discloses true love and affection between them (Rahul and Sheena)"".

On her return to India on April 23, 2012, Indrani and others planned to kill both Sheena and her brother Mikhail and even decided the place for disposal of the bodies, but Mikhail luckily escaped, Badami said.

On the day of murder, after Rahul dropped Sheena at a place (in Mumbai) where Indrani was waiting for her, Indrani hugged her daughter. No previous instance where Indrani may have hugged Sheena came to light in the probe, he said.

Indrani purchased bottles of water, vodka and some sleep inducing medicines, which were given to Sheena. ""After Sheena became drowsy, Indrani killed her and said (to the co-accused) that 'Sheena got her 3BHK flat', he said.

Investigators had earlier said that Sheena had demanded a 3BHK flat from Indrani.
As to Peter's defence that he was not aware of the conspiracy, Badami said Indrani had had a talk with him (on phone). ""Never before the incident they had such a long chat, it was not ordinary call but she was reporting (about the murder) to Peter,"" Badami had earlier argued.

228,GOVE001SRC001,"India Ahead of Makar Sankranti, Mumbai police issues circular imposing total ban on plastic manjha Among all those who have welcomed this decision, bird lovers are the happiest, but they say that the ban should also be on manjha (thread) which is made of glass. 

Highlights Bikers have been killed after having their throats slit while driving. 2 Many times in the past several birds have got entangled in these manjhas. 3 Among all those who have welcomed this decision, bird lovers are the happiest. 
The Mumbai police on Thursday issued a circular stating that using plastic string (manjha) for kite-flying was totally banned and that action would be taken under the IPC against anyone doing so. A copy of the circular copy is available with India Today. 
Mumbaikars have welcomed this initiative by the police. Among all those who have welcomed this decision, bird lovers are the happiest, but they say that the ban should also be on manjha (thread) which is made of glass. Many manjhas are made of broken glasses. In the past, there have been many instances when several birds, crows and pigeons in particular, have got entangled in these manjhas (kite-flying threads). While most of these creatures die, others get so much badly injured that they never fully recover. 
And it is not just birds. Many bikers have been killed or seriously injured after having their throats slit while driving. Many in Mumbai avoid using bikes on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. 
HELPLINE NUMBERS ISSUED 
Several NGOs and bird lovers mention helpline numbers and actively ensure that there is no untoward incident during Makar Sankranti. As a precautionary measure, the Mumbai police this year has banned use of all forms of manjha -- one made of plastic or nylon Manja or made of other synthetic materials. 
During kite-flying festivals, people and birds get injured due to the pucca thread made out of plastic or similar such synthetic materials, commonly known as nylon manjha. In most cases, these injuries prove fatal. 
PLASTIC THREADS NON-BIODEGRADABLE 
Plastic threads also have a very long life. Being non-biodegradable in nature, they can cause serious damage to ecology and animals. After coming in contact with the soil, these manjhas cause problems such as blockages of sewers drainage lines and natural waterways such as river and streams. 
Interestingly, the Mumbai police seems to have comprehensively studied the perils manjhas are to one's safety before giving out the circular as is evident by its having listed all possible warnings.

She tweeted that the two Indian nationals, Syed Asif Ali Nizami who is the head priest (Sajjadanashin) of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia dargah and his nephew Nazim Ali Nizami had gone missing after they landed at Karachi airport. 
Swaraj further said that India has taken up the matter with Pakistan and had requested them for an update on both the Indian nationals. 
According to official sources in New Delhi, Asif Nizami, the chief priest, and Nazim Nizami had gone to visit the famous Data Darbar shrine in Lahore and were to catch a flight from there to Karachi on Wednesday. 
âAs per their families, while Asif was allowed to go to Karachi, Nazim was stopped at the Lahore airport on grounds of incomplete travel papers.â 
âWhile Nazim went missing from Lahore airport, Asif went missing after arriving at the Karachi airport,â a source said. 
The matter has been taken up with the Pakistan government both in New Delhi as well as through the Indian mission in Islamabad, the source said. 
âMy father Syed Asif Ali Nizami, 80, and his nephew Nazim Nizami, 60, went missing from Lahore and Karachi airports, respectively, on Wednesday evening,â Asifâs elder son Sazid Ali Nizami told IANS . 
He said that his father and cousin went to Karachi in Pakistan on 6 March from where they visited Lahore on 13 March to offer âChadarâ at Baba Faridâs shrine, the master of Baba Nizamuddin. 
âOn 14 March, they offered another Chadar at Data Darbar Sufi shrine in Lahore. The next day they reached at Lahore airport to take a flight for Karachi at 4.30 pm. At the Lahore airport, my cousin was stopped by the airport authorities to clear some documentation and my father was asked to board the flight.â 
âMy father reached Karachi airport at 6 pm but my cousin could not join him. At the airport, my father talked to my relatives on phone and informed them to come outside, but he did not come,â Sazid said. 
Sazid further said that my father and cousinâs mobile phones were also switched off. âPakistani authorities and police are still clueless about them,â Sazid said. 
Sazid, however, added that Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and other officials had taken the issue seriously and assured me of taking appropriate action over the issue. 
External Affairs Ministry officials told IANS that they were concerned about the issue and that proper action was being taken. 
According to The Hindu , Nizami and his nephew had reportedly travelled to Lahore by private airlines Shaheen Air. As the Nizamuddin Auliya shrine of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin has very close links with the Data Darbar shrine of Gharib Nawaz or Moinuddin Chisti, âkhadimsâ or custodians exchange visits every year.

However, informed sources said the meeting was likely to remain inconclusive on Sunday since UNC President Gaidon Kamei has been in judicial custody all these months. His release, which many expect to happen sooner than later, could facilitate the talks.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced in Imphal during an election meeting that the blockade would be lifted within 48 hours of the formation of a BJP government in Manipur. 
The UNC imposed the blockade on two national highways, NH 2 and NH 37, on November 1, 2016, in protest against the government's plan to create two districts. However, later the government went on to create seven new districts, saying it was necessary from administrative point of view.
The UNC, Tangkhul Naga Long and other Naga bodies have been saying that the creation of seven districts comprising the ""land of the Nagas left by our forefathers"" is unacceptable.
The Congress government had insisted on holding talks either in Imphal or Delhi, but the present coalition government has agreed to hold talks in Senapati district, where the head office of UNC is located.

Known as Asiaâs longest bi-direction road tunnel in J-K, the project is completed at a cost of Rs.2,519 crore and will reduce the distance by 31 km. 
With 124 CCTV cameras installed inside the tunnel, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has taken care of security inside the tunnel and a team in the control room will monitor activities of the travellers.

251,GOVE008SRC003,"The 9.2 km tunnel, which will bypass snow-and landslide -prone Kud, Patnitop and Batote on National Highway 44, marks significant roadbuilding firsts in India, including an unprecedented stress on user safety. Chenani-Nashri tunnel: On Sunday, April 2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will formally open the longest road tunnel in South Asia, between Chenani and Nashri in Jammu & Kashmir. The 9.2 km tunnel, which will bypass snow-and landslide -prone Kud, Patnitop and Batote on National Highway 44, marks significant roadbuilding firsts in India, including an unprecedented stress on user safety. Here are ten things to know about the tunnel:
1) The work on the 9.2 km-long twin-tube tunnel, which is part of a 286-km-long four-lane project on the highway, started on May 23, 2011, in the lower Himalayan mountain range, and cost Rs 3,720 crore. It is built by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) Ltd.
2) It is located at an altitude of 1,200 metres (nearly 4,000 feet) in difficult Himalayan terrain. It will reduce the travel time on National Highway 44 between Jammu and Srinagar by about 2 hours by shortening the distance between the cities by 30 km, and will altogether bypass Kud, Patnitop and Batote, locations where the highway is prone to being blocked by snow and landslides.
3) The tunnel will be the first in India to be equipped with world class âintegrated tunnel control systemâ through which ventilation, fire control, signals, communication and electrical systems will be automatically actuated.
4) According to an Indian Express report, The tunnel comprises two tubes that run parallel to each other â the main traffic tunnel of diameter 13 m, and a separate safety or escape tunnel of diameter 6 m alongside. The two tubes â each approximately 9 km long â are connected by 29 cross passages at regular intervals along the entire length of the tunnel.
5) With inlets every 8 m bringing fresh air into the main tube, and exhaust outlets every 100 m opening into the escape tube, the Chenani-Nashri tunnel is the countryâs first â and the worldâs sixth â road tunnel with a transverse ventilation system, IL&FS Project Director J S Rathore told IE.
6) Transverse ventilation will keep tailpipe smoke inside the tunnel at a minimum level â this is important, Rathore said, to prevent suffocation and keep visibility at acceptable levels, especially since the tunnel is so long.
7) SOS boxes installed every 150 m will act as emergency hotlines for commuters in distress. To connect to the ITCR to seek help, one would only need to open the door of the SOS box and say âHelloâ, Rathore said. The SOS boxes are also equipped with first-aid facility and some essential medicines. In case of breathlessness, claustrophobia or other discomfort, or in case of breakdown of a vehicle, the commuter will be expected to inform the ITCR the number of the nearest crossway, and an ambulance or crane will be rushed through the parallel escape tunnel, Rathore said.
8) Commuters will also be able to use their mobile phones inside the tunnel. BSNL, Airtel and Idea have set up facilities inside the tunnel to carry signals. To prevent diminution of vision as a result of change in the light while going in or coming out of the tunnel, the lighting inside has been adjusted at a gradient of luminous strength.
9) Despite having been excavated in a difficult Himalayan region, both tubes are 100% waterproof. There will be no seepage of water from the ceilings or any of the walls of the tunnels, Rathore said.
10) Travel will cost an LMV vehicle Rs 55 on one side and Rs 85 for a to-and-fro journey and Rs 1,870 for one month travel, while bigger vehicles like mini buses will have pay Rs 90 as one side toll and Rs 135 for a to-and-fro toll.

The announcement by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) comes on a day on which the federal agency started accepting applications for H-1B visas for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017. 
The USCIS announcement indicated that the US government is going to be tough and stringent in approval of H-1B visas this year. 
The USCIS has a Congressional mandate to issue 65,000 H-1B visas in general category and another 20,000 for those applicants having higher education masters and above -- from US universities in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
Asserting that its multiple measures announced today will further ""deter and detect H-1B visa fraud and abuse"", the USCIS said the H-1B visa programme should help US companies recruit highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country. 
""Yet, too many American workers who are as qualified, willing and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged. Protecting American workers by combating fraud in our employment-based immigration programs is a priority for the USCIS,"" a statement said. 
The USCIS also announced the launch of a email helpline against abuse and fraud of H-1B visas. The USCIS will now onwards take a more targeted approach when making site visits across the country to H-1B petitioners and the work sites of H-1B employees. 
The USCIS will focus on cases where it cannot validate the employer s basic business information through commercially available data; H-1B-dependent employers (those who have a high ratio of H-1B workers as compared to US workers, as defined by statute); and employers petitioning for H-1B workers who work off-site at another company or organisation's location. 
Targeted site visits will allow USCIS to focus resources where fraud and abuse of the H-1B programme may be more likely to occur, and determine whether H-1B dependent employers are evading their obligation to make a good faith effort to recruit US workers, a media release said. 
Noting that it will continue random and unannounced visits nationwide, USCIS said these site visits are not meant to target non-immigrant employees for any kind of criminal or administrative action but rather to identify employers who are abusing the system. 
""Employers who abuse the H-1B visa programme negatively affect US workers, decreasing wages and job opportunities as they import more foreign workers,"" it said. 
""To further deter and detect abuse, USCIS has established an email address which will allow individuals (including both American workers and H-1B workers who suspect they or others may be the victim of H-1B fraud or abuse) to submit tips, alleged violations and other relevant information about potential H-1B fraud or abuse,"" it said.

The court, which was taking cognizance of multiple petitions filed against its previous order on December 15, 2016, did not relax its decision in all other areas. 
Two states, Sikkim and Meghalaya, were exempted from the ruling given their topographical constraints. 
A bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar also observed that licences obtained before the December judgment will remain valid till September 30. However, the licences will be subject to compliance with other directives regarding distance from highways. All other licences will be revoked from tomorrow, April 1.

As the Supreme Court order banning sale of liquor along highways comes into effect from today, the Goa Excise department has formed teams to make sure that the order is followed strictly. As the apex court order will affect over 3,000 liquor joints and shops along the highways in the state, the traders have pinned their hopes on Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar for solution. 
Goa Excise Commissioner Menino DâSouza said the department has dispatched teams across the state to implement the order. âThe order comes into force from today. The teams are on the field (to implement the order),â he said. 
As per the data available with the Excise department, the SC order will affect 2,290 bars and restaurants, 789 retail liquor shops and 99 wholesale shops. 
The Supreme Court yesterday modified its order banning liquor vends within 500 metres on national and state highways, reducing the distance to 220 metres in areas having a population of up to 20,000. The apex court, however, made it clear that its December 15, 2016 order banning such vends within 500 metres of highways shall remain operative for other areas. 
Meanwhile, president of All Goa Liquor Tradersâ Association, Dattaprasad Naik, said he the Chief Minister and briefed him over the issue. 
âWe have faith in Parrikar, who will find a solution to the problem. The state government will try to save livelihood of maximum people,â Naik told PTI. 
âThe Chief Minister has assured that the solution would be found for this problem,â he added. 
The liquor tradersâ body said the SC order, which reduced the distance up to 220 metres for areas with population up to 20,000, would benefit many. 
âThe area from Patravedi to Porvorim (North Goa), Bambolim to Margao (South Goa) and Panaji to Ponda (North Goa) can have liquor outlets up to 220 metres of the highways as these areas fall in panchayats that have population less than 20,000,â said Naik. 
He, however, said that the entire Vasco city will have to close down all the liquor shops as two national highways criss cross through it. 
âThe state government should file a review petition in the SC asking that Goa to be treated on par with Sikkim and Meghalaya, who are given exception from the ban as they are hilly states,â Naik said. 
âGoa is also a hilly state. Moreover, there are several parts in the state, where the distance between waterfront and the highway is not even 350 metres,â he added. 
According to the Excise department, it has started getting applications for renewal of licences. 
âThose liquor-selling outlets, which do not fall under the purview of SC order, will have their licences renewed, but those which are banned will not be allowed to operate,â DâSouza said. ",GOVT

Liquor vends within 500 metres of national and state highways will have to shut down from tomorrow, the Supreme Court today said, exempting hill states of Sikkim, Meghalaya and Himachal Pradesh and areas having population up to 20,000.

In a significant order passed on pleas of various states seeking modification of the court's December 15, 2016 verdict, a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar also made it clear that the judgement banning liquor vends along highways would also be applicable to bars, pubs and restaurants as drunken driving leads to fatal road accidents.

The bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, said that ""it is suitably modifying"" its December 15 verdict as there has been ""some substance"" in seeking the relief and exempted Sikkim and Meghalaya from the 500-metre cap on liquor vends alongside highways.

It further modified the 500-metre cap rule for Himachal Pradesh and local areas which are alongside highways with a population up to 20,000, and said that they may have liquor vends at a distance of 220 metres from the highways.

On the issue of non-extension of liquor vends' licences beyond March 31, the apex court said the licences, which were given before December 15, 2016, will be valid till September 30 in case of Telangana and the same would be operational till June 30 in Andhra Pradesh.

The court, however, did not give relief to Tamil Nadu, represented by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, from the 500- metre criteria.

The bench said that the count's direction that no licences for liquor vends on highways would be renewed after March 31 would remain effective for rest of the country.

The court had yesterday reserved its order on pleas for a relook at its verdict banning liquor vends along national and state highways from April 1 with the attorney general saying the judgement needed rectification as the ""budget of the states will go for a six"".

Rohatgi had said national highways and state highways cannot be compared and what can be considered for the former cannot be considered for the latter.

Besides some liquor vendors' associations, states like Kerala, Punjab and Telangana had approached the apex court seeking modification of the judgement.

The court had ordered a ban on all liquor shops along the national as well as the state highways and had made it clear that licences of existing shops will not be renewed after March 31.

The verdict had come on a PIL alleging that nearly 1.42 lakh people died per year in road mishaps and that the drunken driving is a major contributor.

It had also directed that all signages indicating the presence of liquor vends will be prohibited along national and state highways.",GOVT

Trump's 33-year-old son, Eric, told The Daily Telegraph on Monday that the strike was influenced in part by Ivanka , who he said was ""heartbroken and outraged"" by the chemical attack.

""Ivanka is a mother of three kids and she has influence,"" Eric Trump said, speaking with the newspaper at Trump Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland. ""I'm sure she said, 'Listen, this is horrible stuff.' My father will act in times like that.""
Trump himself was ""deeply affected"" by the pictures of children being ""sprayed down by hoses to keep their skin from burning,"" according to his son. ""It was horrible. These guys are savages and I'm glad he responded the way he responded.""
He described the president as ""a great thinker, practical not impulsive,"" and added: ""I'm proud he took that action, and believe me he thinks things through.""
Asked about Russia's threats of military escalation following the strike, Eric Trump told the Telegraph his father would not be intimidated.
""There will be no one harder â he has got more backbone than anybody,"" he said. ""He is not a guy who gets intimidated. I can tell you he is tough and he won't be pushed around. The cards will shake out the way they do but he's tough.""
Russia is a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been battling rebels trying to unseat him for more than six years.
He said Trump was ""deeply committed"" to building America's military strength and said he was a ""big believer in Ronald Reagan's philosophy of achieving peace through strength.""
During the campaign, Trump and his team had pledged to rebuild a Washington-Moscow relationship that deteriorated since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. FBI Director James Comey has testified that his agency is investigating whether members of Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.
Eric Trump said his dad has only argued that the U.S. should be ""best friends with other superpowers"" and described allegations of improper links with Russia as ""ridiculous.""
""If there was anything that [the strike on] Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,"" he said.
Critics of former President Barack Obama said he went back on his promise to act if the Syrian regime crossed the ""red line"" of using chemical weapons. Back then, Trump was one of the voices cautioning his predecessor to follow an isolationist policy, once tweeting that ""we should stay the hell out of Syria.""
His son acknowledged this but said that recent events had changed the picture.
""And by the way, he was anti doing anything with Syria two years ago,"" Eric Trump told the Telegraph . ""Then a leader gasses their own people, women and children, at some point America is the global leader and the world's superpower has to come forward and act and they did with a lot of support of our allies and I think that's a great thing.""

The Election Commission conducted the bypoll to the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat, which saw large- scale violence during polling yesterday, ""ignoring"" the advice of the Home Ministry which had said atmosphere was not conducive to hold the polls. 
Immediately after the announcement of schedule for the byelections on March 10, the Home Ministry had sent a strongly worded letter to the Election Commission saying there was no prior consultation with it regarding the bypolls in Srinagar and Anantnag constituencies. 
The Home Ministry had said the atmosphere in the Kashmir Valley was not conducive and hence polling should be delayed and preferably held after panchayat elections are conducted in the next few months. 
However, the Election Commission ignored the Home Ministry's advice and went ahead with its schedule for bypolls in Srinagar and Anantnag seats, official sources said. 
While polling in Srinagar was held on Sunday, byelection in Anantnag will be held on Wednesday. 
Sources said for holding the bypolls in both the constituencies, the Election Commission held a meeting with a Joint Secretary on March 17 and sought 300 companies (30,000 personnel) of paramilitary forces and the request was duly accepted and fulfilled. 
The number of paramilitary personnel sought by the EC was very high. But despite presence of a large number of security personnel, the violence yesterday was unusually high, the sources said. 
There were 190 incidents of stone pelting, 120 polling boths were made dysfunctional, 24 EVMs were looted, two schools burnt down, eight people were killed and 150 others were injured in Srinagar yesterday. 
There is an atmosphere of fear in both the constituencies following the poll boycott call given by the separatists. 
Besides, such large-scale violence had not taken place in the Kashmir Valley in a single day in last 15 years, sources said. 
Normal life has been affected in the Kashmir Valley due to the strike called by separatists. Shops, fuel stations and other business establishments were shut, while attendance in banks and government offices was low. 
Internet services remained suspended for the second day today. Public transport was off the roads, while private transport was minimal.

Eight civilians were killed in Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir during the by-election to Srinagar parliamentary constituency, which witnessed a low turnout of just 7.14 per cent, the worst in the last 30 years.
There were 200 incidents of violence across the constituency in which around 45 people were also injured. Around 65 CRPF personnel were injured in todayâs violent protests, which were continuing in many places.
In many places polling booths had to be shifted after they were attacked by protesters.
The civilians were killed when security forces opened fire on a group of such protesters in Dalwan village in Budgam district.

As many as 17 polling stations were closed after protesters clashed with forces while 14 EVMs were damaged or snatched during the poll.
Official sources said, âFive polling stations were closed at Nowgam in Srinagar after fierce clashes erupted near the polling stations. All the polling staff and EVMs were escorted and kept at Nowgam bypass, where forces were deployed.â
Chief Electoral Officer Jammu and Kashmir Shantmanu said that the total voting percentage was recorded at 7.14 per cent. Separatist leaders had called for a boycott of the by-polls, resulting in heightened security and low voter turnout. Shops, gas stations and other businesses remained closed and public transport was halted, impacting normalcy in the istricts of Srinagar, Budgam and Ganderbal which went to poll. Internet services had also been cut off.
Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah, who is the NC-Congress alliance candidate for the seat, after casting his vote in Srinagar condemned the poll violence.

Seven persons were killed at three places in Budgam district and one in Ganderbal, where protestors clashed with security forces. 
""The security forces opened fire to protect the polling staff,"" the officer said, alleging that mobs tried to storm many polling stations and destroy EVMs. 
The seven percent voter turnout is the lowest in the state in 27 years. In the 2014 general election, the constituency had recorded 26 percent turnout. 
The by-poll was the first after the 2016 unrest, triggered by the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani. Over 100 people were killed in five months of the unrest â the worst in six years of the troubled Valley. 
""It was an unfortunate day. Over 100 security personnel were injured. The turnout was 7.09 per cent,"" chief electoral officer Shantmanu told media persons. 
He also said that re-polling will be held at 100 polling stations that witnessed early closure on Monday. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah said it was the worst poll-related violence he had seen in his 20-year of political career. 
""Have contested six elections over 20 years and have never seen this level of violence in elections in Kashmir,"" Abdullah tweeted, hitting out at the state government over the violence and accused chief minister Mehbooba Mufti of failing to provide a conducive atmosphere for voting. 
""Mehbooba Mufti is responsible for this situation. There is mismanagement,"" he said. Security was stepped up after separatists extended shutdown call till 12 April â election day in south Kashmir. Authorities have also decided to suspend internet services and postponed the university examinations scheduled. 
The stakes were high for opposition National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and ruling Peoples Democratic Party's Nazir Ahmed Khan, the main contestants. In all, nine candidates were in the fray. The seat fell vacant after then PDP leader Tariq Hameed Karra resigned to protest alleged atrocities on people during the 2016 agitation.

According to an official statement, 24 airports in the western region, 17 in northern region, 11 in southern region, 12 in east and 6 in north-eastern parts of the country are proposed to be connected under this scheme. 
Under this programme, the government intends to connect 45 unserved and under-served airports. 
Five airlines were awarded 128 routes under the scheme last month after a bidding process. 
The selected airline operator would have to provide 50 per cent of the flight capacity with a cap of Rs 2500 per hour on fixed wing aircraft and a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 13 on helicopters with the same price cap.

During his day-long visit to the Queen of Hills, which saw mild showers in the morning, Modi underscored the thrust on keeping the air fares within the reach of the middle class. 

""My dream was to see a person who wears a 'hawai chappal' to fly on the 'hawai jahaz' or plane,"" he said in his almost 20-minute address in Hindi. 

Air India subsidiary Alliance Air, which will operate the Delhi-Shimla flight, has put the fare at Rs 2,036. 

He said the UDAN scheme caters to the aspirations of the people of India, making flights cheaper than taxi fare. 

""The lives of the middle class are being transformed and their aspirations are increasing. Earlier, aviation was considered to be the domain of a select few. That has changed now,"" Modi said. 

The Prime Minister foresees tier-II and tier-III cities as ""growth engines"" with the country's aviation sector filled with opportunities. 

""If aviation connectivity in tier-II and tier-III cities is enhanced in these places, it will be beneficial,"" he said. 

""We had the opportunity to frame a civil aviation policy, which caters to the aspirations of the people of India.

The Shimla airport had been shut for scheduled flights since September 6, 2012, affecting tourists and business travellers. 

Air India subsidiary Alliance Air will operate the Delhi-Shimla flight. 

The seating capacity of the airlines under the UDAN scheme will range from 19 to 78. Fifty per cent of the seats in every flight will have a fare cap of Rs 2,500 per hour. 

The airline companies chosen are Airline Allied Services (Alliance Air), SpiceJet , Turbo Megha Airways, Air Deccan and Air Odisha . 

The operations under the scheme are intended to provide air connectivity to unserved and remote routes, with airfare capped at Rs 2,500 for an hour's journey of around 500 km, the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement. 

The scheme caps airfare for an hour-long journey of approximately 500 km on a fixed wing aircraft or for 30 minute journey on a helicopter at Rs 2,500. 

The UDAN Scheme is a key component of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) which was released on June 15 last year.

New Delhi: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi met CPM leader Sitaram Yechury for 45 minutes today, over a cup of coffee, the latter said. Mr Gandhi has sought the Left's support for an amendment that the Congress' Jairam Ramesh will seek tomorrow when four GST or Goods and Services Tax bills are voted on in the Rajya Sabha. The government is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha and the Congress can, with the help of other opposition parties, get the amendment passed by the House. Because they are Money Bills, the changes approved by the Rajya Sabha will not be binding on the Lok Sabha or Lower House to which the bills will then return. The Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject the changes.But the Rajya Sabha approving amendments will be an embarrassment for the government like the one it suffered last week, when the Upper House returned the Finance Bill with amendments for the first time ever. The Lok Sabha quickly took the amendments down.Opposition parties have accused the government of undermining the Rajya Sabha by moving legislation as Money Bills.Government sources said they hoped the Congress' amendment will not be approved by the Rajya Sabha. But even if they are, the sources said, they will be ""rejected within 24 hours in the Lok Sabha."" The four bills have already been cleared by the Lok Sabha, where the government has a big majority, last week. Mr Ramesh wants the bills to mandate parliamentary approval of the recommendations of the powerful GST council, which is made up of state finance ministers and is headed by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The Congress leader has argued that the government cannot have sole discretion to issue an executive notification to accept recommendations of the council.A senior minister described this as a move to sabotage GST, saying it was impractical to have parliament and every state assembly pass GST council recommendations.The government wants parliament's approval in the Budget session to be able to meet a July deadline to launch GST, a unified tax that will subsume all indirect taxes.

270,GOVE016SRC001,"VIPs will not be allowed to flaunt red beacons atop their vehicles from May 1, the government announced on Wednesday, in a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress termed it as mere ""symbolic politics"".
The decision was taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who informed the cabinet about it. Soon after the announcement, several ministers removed the red beacons from their vehicles.
""From May 1, no red beacon will be allowed atop any official vehicle. There will be no exceptions,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters here after the cabinet meeting.
""It is more precisely the Prime Minister's decision. He only informed the cabinet about it,"" Jaitley told reporters after the cabinet meet.
Vehicles involved in emergency and relief and rescue services, ambulances and fire services, will, however, be allowed to blue beacons, the Minister said.
Jaitley said the government will bring about the necessary amendment to the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, in this regard.
""Rule 108 deals with use of red, white and blue lights on vehicles. Rule 108-1 (III) says the Centre and states can specify dignitaries who can use beacons on their (official) vehicles. It is a central rule and is being abolished from the rule book,"" Jaitley said.
He said it means no dignitary at the Centre or in states could henceforth use beacons on their vehicles.
Asked if there would be exceptions for the President or the Prime Minister, Jaitley said there can't be any exceptions ""when the rule itself is not there in the rule book"".
The Minister said Rule 108 (2) that empowers the Centre and state governments to use blue beacons with flasher is also being changed.
""Only defined emergency services will be allowed to use blue beacons with flasher,"" Jaitley said.
The decision intends to strengthen democratic values in the country, the Finance Minister said, and added that the consequential changes required to be made in other rules will be made.
Soon after the cabinet meet, several Union ministers and other high dignitaries removed the red beacons from their vehicles.
Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari was probably the first to have the red beacon removed after the cabinet meeting.
""The government is of the considered opinion that beacons on vehicles are perceived symbols of VIP culture and have no place in a democratic country,"" Gadkari said. ""They have no relevance whatsoever.""
Within a few hours of the decision, ""#EveryoneVIPinNewIndia"" became the top trend on Twitter.
Welcoming the decision, Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara Raje in a tweet said: ""Curtailing the use of #RedBeacon is a welcome and forward looking step towards having more people-friendly Government. #EveryoneVIPinNewIndia.""
Minister of Textile Smriti Irani tweeted her official car's picture after removing the red beacon and said, ""Removed 'Lal Batti' from my car. PM @narendramodi ji's decision is a welcome step towards reaffirming our belief in #EveryoneVIPinNewIndia.""
Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Vijay Goel and Minister of State in Prime Ministers Office, posted videos of their car without beacons.
In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said he has stopped using the red beacon with immediate effect.
The Congress, however, termed the decision as ""symbolic politics"" and ""ridiculous"".
""This is not something new. The Supreme Court had on December 10, 2013, ordered which vehicles would be allowed to have beacons atop them,"" said Congress spokesman and former Union Minister Manish Tiwari.
""Now, after three years of this decision, if the BJP is trying to do politics over it and trying to gain the high moral ground, then it is ridiculous,"" he added.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 20, 2017 7:01 pm Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File Photo) 
Hours after the Union Cabinet decided to do away with red beacons on top of officials cars, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said, âEvery Indian is special. Every Indian is a VIP.â The Prime Minister was responding to a tweet that hailed his governmentâs decision to remove red beacons atop official cars. While responding to comments on Twitter, PM Modi also said that it was out of touch with the spirit of ânew Indiaâ. 
The Prime Ministerâs response comes after the Union Cabinet decision today to ban red beacons atop vehicles of VVIPs, including the Prime Minister, President and Vice President. Many Cabinet ministers, such as Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari , Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, as well as Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis , have already removed red beacons from their official cars. The decision is to be implemented by May 1. 
Also read: Why 2001 attack on Parliament prompted Delhi Police to crackdown on the illegal use of red beacons 
While briefing the press regarding the decision, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said, âA red light can be carried in vehicles of high dignitaries specified by the Central and State government. Now, neither in state or centre the government will be able to nominate any members to use the red beacon. There are no exceptions.â He added that the rule will not apply to the fire brigade, ambulance services, police vehicles and other emergency services, which will be allowed to use the blue beacon. 
The ban will apply to the Prime Minister, all Union ministers, chief ministers, state cabinet ministers, bureaucrats and judges in the High Court and Supreme Court. 
The Union Cabinetâs decision comes close on the heels of the Uttar Pradesh and Punjab governmentsâ decision against the use of âlal battiâ on official cars.

Reply Joydeep Apr 20, 2017 at 5:32 am First of all the aam aadmi party had proposed this a long time back. The banning of the red beacon in most of the vehicles is merely a cosmetic exercise. It won't make any difference as the convoy will be led by a police patrol car with red beacon, red flags, siren, clearing the roads for the VIP. Next the convoy will be 5 to 25 vehicle long (depending on who the VIP is). Many so called ""VIP"" cars will switch to other colored beacons like white, yellow, and purple. This VIP culture is not going to change unless the mentality changes. Reply Test Apr 20, 2017 at 5:54 am So what you suggest is let people keep their red beacons and wait for the mentality to change? I think the first mentality change thats required is to learn to appreciate whatever good someone is trying to do in his capacity?

Asserting that VIP culture should go away as he had always stood in support of abolishing the red beacon system, Swamy told ANI that such a system is meaningless and makes no sense as it was introduced by the British.
""I welcome this step. It was necessary. I have been saying this for very long. why do we have this special red light? What is it that you think you will get?...This red light is meaningless. The British introduced all this so the Congress people thought they are the descendant of this English man. Especially after a foreign woman became their president they became more confident. So, I think this is a very good step and a symbolic step and we should take more symbolic steps,"" he added.
The Centre yesterday decided to ban red beacons atop cars of all ministers, politicians and bureaucrats, ending a privilege that was seen as the ultimate status symbol.
The ban, effective from May 1, doesn't exempt even vehicles of the country's top dignitaries such as the President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India.
But ambulances and vehicles of the fire service, police, and army will be allowed to use blue flashing beacons to cut through traffic.
It was reported last week that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has called a meeting to discuss whether the red beacon should be discarded or restricted to certain dignitaries.
Captain Amarinder Singh and Yogi Adityanath, the new chief ministers of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, have already taken steps to either end or restrict VIP culture.
In its first cabinet meeting, chaired by Captain Amarinder, the newly formed Punjab Government decided to completely shun the VIP culture by removing the red, yellow and blue beacons from their official vehicles.

Those injured have been admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where they are recuperating.

The boat had more than 40 people on board. Most of them were returning after attending the kite festival at Sabbalpur Diara on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.

While some of them swam to safety, many others are reported missing. The divers from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were pressed into service to trace those believed to be missing. Till the time of reporting, the rescue operation was on.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the boat tragedy. âA three-member committee will look into the incident, including how the boat capsized,â said an official, adding that the kite festival was organised by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC).

The three-day kite festival was organised by the BSTDC from January 14 to 17, wherein a large area of Sabbalpur Diara (north of Ganga) was earmarked and barricaded so that people could fly kites. The festival timing was from 10 am to 5 pm, so that everyone could return before it was dark.

Sources said while returning in the evening, the boat was ferrying more persons than its permissible capacity. 

As a consequence, the boat capsized near Law College. Unconfirmed reports said the engine of the boat failed midway. As a result, it capsized before it could reach the Gandhi Ghat.

âTwenty one bodies have been recovered so far,â said an official.

The government has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those killed.

The tourism department had organised its annual âPatang Utsavâ (kite fest) on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at the Sabbalpur bank off the NIT ghat. 
The festival of Makar Sankranti turned tragic when two overloaded boats capsized in River Ganga, near the NIT Ghat, claiming at least 20 lives and grievously injuring several others around sunset on Saturday. Among the deceased are several women and children. âIn all, 20 bodies have been recovered,â Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said. Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said prima facie the accident took place due to overloading. The Bihar tourism department had organised its annual âPatang Utsavâ (kite fest) on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at the Sabbalpur bank off the NIT ghat. The administration had also arranged for free boat passage to the bank and thousands of people participated in the event throughout the day. According to eye-witnesses, the accident took place around sunset when an overloaded boat, with about 50-60 people aboard, collided with another boat and both drowned only a few metres away from the bank. A video of the accidents shows, the second boat was trying to ease the load from the overladen boat midstream and both capsized. While few people swam their way across to the bank, several were feared trapped under the boat. About 10 injured were admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the accident and has ordered a high-level probe into it. He has also asked the officials to find out what was the programme for which such a large number of people had travelled to that area of the river and what arrangements had been made for it. An ex gratia of Rs four lakh each will be given to the kin of those who died in the boat accident, state disaster management department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said.

279,NATE003SRC001,"A series of winter storms is forecast to continue hammering California with several feet of heavy snow and driving rain over the next few days and into the weekend, good news for the drought-plagued state and for ski areas, but potentially bad news for travelers and homeowners worried about floods and mudslides. 
Meanwhile, a storm could also spread a stripe of snow across the South, all the way from Texas to Virginia, from late Thursday into Saturday. 
In the West, ""the combination of storms through this weekend has the potential to bring the biggest amount of rain and mountain snow to California since the drought began several years ago,"" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jim Andrews . 
Storm total has now reached 4.5 FEET! 
Several feet of snow have already fallen in the Sierra Nevada from one storm, and several more feet is on the way from a second, more intense storm that should hit over the weekend. 
One ski area, Squaw Alpine, has recorded 4.5 feet, according to its Twitter account. 
Another 10 to 15 feet of snow could bury portions of the Sierra over the next 10 days, according to WeatherBell meteorologist Ryan Maue. 
Enormous snow totals still modeled: 10-15+feet from warm, very moist series of Atmospheric Rivers down-spouting over Sierra â Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) January 4, 2017 

Closer to the coast, heavy rain could lead to flooding, mudslides and debris flows in both the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas, the National Weather Service warned. 
The source of the heavy rain and snow in the West is what meteorologists call an ""atmospheric river,"" which acts like a fire hose to funnel moisture from the tropical Pacific toward California. 
These rivers transport huge amounts of water vapor â the gas form of liquid water â toward the West, where it's wrung out in the form of rain and snow, noted Mashable's Andrew Freedman . 
If one originates near Hawaii, it's sometimes referred to the Pineapple Express. Southern snow? 
Any snow that falls in the South over the next few days will be measured in inches, not feet, but it doesn't take much to wreak traffic chaos there. After one round of snow Thursday in the Ohio Valley and Appalachians, more substantial snow could fall by Friday and Saturday in the South. 
According to AccuWeather, cities at greatest risk for some snow, a wintry mix or flash freeze Friday and Saturday include Jackson, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, Winston-Salem and Raleigh, N.C.; and Richmond, Va.

Meteorologists are forecasting up to 15 inches of rain in the Sierra Nevada, while higher elevations could see an additional 2 feet of snow on Saturday alone, causing a travel nightmare. 
Much of California remains in the throes of a decade-long drought, but the weekend forecast might have you believing otherwise. 
Welcome rain has come, and the snowpack is above normal in many places. Last year, ski resorts had to open late, close early or not open at all due to a lack of snowfall. This year is quite the opposite: Places such as Alpine and Soda Springs received more than 75 inches of fresh powder with the latest weather system, and another one is right on its heels. 
But with some relief comes challenges. 
The National Weather Service office in Sacramento says this weekend ""could be the greatest potential for significant flooding we've seen in over 10 years."" Meteorologists are forecasting up to 15 inches of rain in the Sierra Nevada, while higher elevations could see an additional 2 feet of snow on Saturday alone, causing a travel nightmare. 
An earlier storm dumped several feet of snow in lower elevations, and this system will bring mostly rain in those same areas. The rain will melt the snow and cause additional runoff, possibly leading to significant flooding and even landslides. 
The cause of the expected flooding: a weather phenomenon known as an atmospheric river, a column of moisture that flows inland from the Pacific. An atmospheric river can be 250 to 375 miles wide. 
A strong atmospheric river ""transports an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to 7.5-15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the Mississippi River,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
NOAA says, ""On average, about 30%-50% of annual precipitation in the (West Coast) states occurs in just a few (atmospheric river) events, thus contributing to water supply"" and unfortunately, flooding. 
So much rain and snow at one time can be catastrophic to some, but it's very much a Catch-22 since California desperately needs the moisture. There has been a vast improvement in drought conditions this year compared with last, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
Last year, 100% of the state was in a drought, but that number is now down to 81%. At this point in 2016, nearly 45% of the state was in exceptional drought. It's now 18%. Most of the improvement is in the northern part of the state, while the south is still suffering. 
Unfortunately, the next few storm systems don't seem like they'll bring much relief to Southern California. But Californians can only hope that this wetter trend will bring needed relief from the state's crippling drought.

The moth is described for the first time by evolutionary biologist Dr Vazrick Nazari in the latest edition of the journal Zookeys, after being discovered hidden in the collections if the Bohart Museum of Entomology at the University of California.
Both Trump and the moth share a similar habitat, stretching across the states of California, USA although it can also be found in Mexico.
The moth is under threat from urbanisation Dr Nazari said the new insect, which is a type of twirler moth, bore an uncanny resemblance to Mr Trump because of the yellowish-white scales on its head. The scientists said the tuft reminded him of the incoming president's hairstyle.
It is hoped that naming the new moth after Mr Trump will highlight the critical need for further conservation in fragile areas such as the habitat of the new species which is under serious threat from urbanisation.
""The discovery of this distinct micro-moth in the densely populated and otherwise zoologically well-studied southern California underscores the importance of conservation of the fragile habitats that still contain undescribed and threatened species, and highlights the paucity of interest in species-level taxonomy of smaller faunal elements in North America,"" says discoverer Dr Nazari.
""By naming this species after the 45th President of the United States, I hope to bring some public attention to, and interest in, the importance of alpha-taxonomy in better understanding the neglected micro-fauna component of the North American biodiversity.""

Scientists have named a species of moth after President-elect Donald Trump, days before he is to assume the office as the 45th President of the US. The moth,whose specimen already exists in the collections of the Bohart Museum of Entomology at the University of California, is now officially described as Neopalpa donaldtrumpi. 
It stands out with yellowish-white scales present on the head in adults. And these scales showed an amusing reference to Trumpâs hairstyle and turned it into an additional justification for its name, said Vazrick Nazari, an evolutionary biologist and systematist. 
âThe discovery of this distinct micro-moth in the densely populated and otherwise zoologically well-studied southern California underscores the importance of conservation of the fragile habitats that still contain undescribed and threatened species and highlights the paucity of interest in species-level taxonomy of smaller faunal elements in North America,â Nazari added. 
Trumpâs flying namesake is a type of twirler moths and lives in a substantially urbanised and populated habitat, stretching across the states of California in US and Baja California in Mexico. The habitat is under serious threat. 
According to researchers, the stardom surrounding the moth will encourage conservation efforts. 
âBy naming this species after the 45th President of the US, I hope to bring some public attention to and interest in the importance of alpha-taxonomy in better understanding the neglected micro-fauna component of the North American biodiversity,â Nazari noted. 
The study was published in the journal ZooKeys.

287,NATE005SRC003,"A tiny moth from California has become the first creature named after President-elect Donald Trump. 
The Neopalpa donaldtrumpi has a very recognizable âhairstyleâ. 
The tiny moth was discovered in California by Canadian researcher Vazrick Nazari. 
The name was inspired by the striking golden flakes covering its head, which Vazrick Nazari likened to the soon-to-be 45th president of the United Statesâ famous mop. 
Nine species were named after President Barack Obama during his term in office. 
What Donald Trump will make of the honor remains to be seen â especially as the tiny moth, with its wingspan of just more than a centimeter, is native to southern California and the Mexican region of Baja California. 
However, Vazrick Nazari said he hoped it would inspire President Trump to prioritize ecological issues during his term in office. 
Vazrick Nazari told Live Science : âI hope that the president will make conservation of such fragile ecosystems in the US his top priority. These ecosystems still contain many undiscovered and undescribed species, and deserve to be protected for future generations.â

Heavy thunderstorms will continue to pose dangers to travelers and outdoor enthusiasts across the southwestern United States into the end of the week. 
The thunderstorms will blossom during the afternoon and early evening hours and carry the most rainfall from Arizona to New Mexico, Colorado and eventually, the Texas Panhandle. 
Thunderstorm activity will tend to dwindle in Southern California towards the end of the week. 
âShelter should be sought at the first sign of threatening weather â flooding and lightning threats are both dangers that can come on suddenly,â AccuWeather Meteorologist Faith Eherts said. 
From January through July of this year, 11 lightning deaths have been reported across the United States, according to the National Weather Service. This is down from 22 deaths during the same time period in 2016. 
Head into a car or building at the first clap of thunder. If hiking, avoid seeking shelter under a lone tree and head for a valley or depression in the terrain. 
The lightning will not only endanger those caught outdoors, but also raise the risk of sparking a wildfire. Thunderstorms that produce little to no rainfall and lightning that strikes dry ground will carry the greatest risk of igniting a blaze. 
On the other end of the spectrum, there will also be thunderstorms that produce a tremendous amount of rainfall and flash flooding. 
Several inches of rain can pour down in a matter of hours, quickly turning streets and dry beds into swift-moving and dangerous rivers. 
âThose planning on visiting Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico or Coloradoâs Mesa Verde National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park may need to adjust or postpone their plans in order to stay safe,â Eherts said. 
Investing in a weather radio can warn anyone hiking or camping in remote areas of important weather alerts even if cell phone service is not available. 
Haboobs, or dust storms, can be suddenly triggered by gusty thunderstorm winds. This risk will extend dozens of miles away from the stormâs location. 
Motorists along interstates 8, 10, 15, 17 and 40 could face near-zero visibility if a wall of dust overtakes the roadway. Pedestrians should head indoors until the dust has settled to avoid eye irritation or respiratory problems. 
An intrusion of dry air may limit the amount of thunderstorm development across Arizona late in the weekend and early next week. However, heavy thunderstorms will continue to focus across Colorado, New Mexico and West Texas, while spotty thunderstorms will expand into the northern Rockies.

The tourist towns of Shimla, Kufri, Kasauli, Chamba, Dharamsala, Palampur and Manali may get heavy rain, he added. Incessant rainfall in the region in the past had triggered massive landslides that blocked many roads, including the national highways leading to picturesque tourist resorts Manali and Shimla.

However, picturesque tourist resort Manali, which normally remains a magnet for holidaymakers due to pleasant weather, saw a decline in footfall. ""The only reason for Manali to get fewer bookings this time is the negative publicity by the media regarding frequent landslides on the national highway linking it,"" he added. According to Tourism Department estimates, over 75,000 tourists are likely to visit the state during these four days starting with Saturday and ending with the Independence Day on Tuesday. Many were likely to manage by taking an off or leave for one day on Monday. Added D.P.

306,PLTE002SRC001,"Under pressure from political and other outfits, Bollywood film producers today announced that they will not engage with Pakistani artistes, clearing decks for the smooth release of Karan Johar's ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" as MNS withdrew its threat to stall the screening. 

Johar accompanied by Producers' Guild President Mukesh Bhatt met Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis at his home 'Varsha' here this morning where Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, whose party has been opposing the release, was also present.



MNS had threatened to disrupt the screening of the film as it features Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. 

Johar has agreed to put a special mention in the beginning of the film paying homage to martyrs, a move to assuage sentiments in the country triggered by the terror attack on an army base in Uri that claimed the lives of 19 security personnel. 

Producers Sidharth Roy Kapur, Sajid Nadiadwala and Vijay Singh of Fox Star Studios were also present in the meeting. 

Bhatt told reporters that the meeting was ""positive and constructive and 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will release as per the schedule."" 

""We discussed the unfortunate events related to the film's release. I shared the film industry's emotions regarding the entire issue. We are Indians first and then comes our business,"" he said. 

Bhatt said they have assured the CM that neither the Producers' Guild nor any filmmaker will work with any Pakistani artiste or technician in the future. 

Also, the Guild will call a meeting to pass a resolution on not working with Pakistani artistes. A copy of the same would be sent to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry as well as the Chief Minister, he said. 

""Karan Johar will display a slate of tribute for Uri martyrs before 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' starts playing out in the screens. It is a tribute from us to our soldiers,"" Bhatt said. 

The makers of the film, slated to release on October 28, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma in lead roles, will also contribute a portion of its revenue to the army welfare fund as demanded by MNS. 

Thackeray said MNS laid down three conditions that filmmakers who worked with Pakistani actors have to comply with. These include a contribution of Rs 5 crore to the Army welfare fund. 

The Producers' Guild has agreed to the demand, Bhatt said.
After the meeting, Thackeray said, ""I am told that all the 

three demands of MNS have been accepted by the producers. Before the beginning of the movie, a tribute should be offered at every screening to the jawans who were martyred in various terror strikes including recent Uri and Pathankot attacks. 

""The producers should also put a blanket ban on Pakistani artistes, singers and technicians henceforth. Every producer, who has so far cast Pakistani actors, should give Rs 5 crore to the Army welfare fund as an atonement. The producers should handover the cheque to the Defence Minister and make the photo public."" 

The trouble, however, is not completely over for Johar's film as Cinema Owners Exhibitors Association of India (COEAI), which has presence in four states, has decided to stick to its stand of not screening the movie in their theatres. 

""The stand we took earlier continues. The final stand will be taken by the executive committee on Monday. Maybe, the decision will not change even then as we are firm on our stand.

Film & Television Producers Guild of India president Mukesh Bhatt, producers Sidharth Roy Kapur, Sajid Nadiadwala and Vijay Singh of Fox Star Studios were also present in the meeting.
""Every producer who has cast a Pakistani actor must contribute Rs 5 crore to the Army welfare fund,"" MNS chief Raj Thackeray said after the meeting.

Thackeray said that ""producers will have to give in writing that they will not take Pakistani actors in their films in future.""
Claiming victory for MNS agitation, Raj Thackeray said: ""We have always protested against Pakistani artistes but Bollywood never understood earlier. Now they have realised.""
Earlier, speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mukesh Bhatt said that it was ""positive and constructive and 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will release as per the schedule.""

308,PLTE002SRC003,"Mumbai, Oct 22 (IANS) Filmmaker Karan Johar received a major breather when the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Saturday allowed the release of ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" but with a rider -- all the producers who employed Pakistani artists, must pay Rs 5 crore each into the Indian Army's welfare fund as an atonement. Distributors and cinema owners have also come forward in support of the film.

The MNS decision followed Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' direct intervention in the matter -- a day after Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh visited Mumbai and two days after he met representatives of Bollywood.

Fadnavis convened a meeting on Saturday which was attended by MNS President Raj Thackeray, Karan Johar and Film and Television Producers Guild of India's President Mukesh Bhatt, among others at his official residence, Varsha, to resolve the imbroglio.

""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" has been in news for featuring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan.

Thackeray said henceforth, all Pakistani artistes, including actors, singers and directors shall be permanently banned from Bollywood.

""Why should Pakistani actors be given the red carpet welcome when our soldiers are being killed on the borders? Was the Uri attack the first one,"" Thackeray said.

The MNS also imposed certain conditions on the release of ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"", including that the producers making a handsome contribution to the army welfare fund, and slides paying tribute to the brave Indian soldiers are shown before the start of the film in theatres -- to which both Bhatt and Johar readily agreed.

The film also stars Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma.

""We have always raised our voice against Pakistani actors, cricketers coming and working here

This is our victory,"" Thackeray asserted, virtually pulling the rug from under his rival, cousin Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.

Interestingly, the Shiv Sena has been agitating against Pakistani artistes, writers, and cricketers since several decades and is currently a coalition partner with Bharatiya Janata Party in Maharashtra and in the NDA at the Centre.

Raj Thackeray demanded that each producer employing Pakistani artistes must contribute Rs 5 crore to the army welfare funds as 'atonement' (Prayashchit) for their actions.

The decision by MNS and Fadnavis was later criticised by various other political party leaders.

Opposition Congress termed the 'settlement (mandavli)' as ""shocking and unconstitutional"".

""It is the prerogative of the central government to impose a ban on Pakistani artistes, the CM's duty is to only ensure law and order in the state

The CM could have made a request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it's a matter concerning foreign affairs. Fadnavis has interfered in Modi's domain,"" Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.

Maharashtra Samajwadi Party President Abu Asim Azmi termed it as ""a publicity stunt of MNS ending in a 'settlement' as was expected by all"".

""This country believes in law and order

In future, the state government must tackle such 'threats' by implementing the law and teach such elements a lesson,"" Azmi urged.

Not only political leaders, filmmaker and social activist Ashoke Pandit also took to Twitter to condemn MNS' demand and said that they are asking for ""extortion"".

""Producers who have Pakistan actors in their films to donate Rs 5 crore is unreasonable. Donation has to be from the heart. When forced, it's extortion,"" Pandit tweeted.

Trouble for ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" began when the debate about letting Pakistani artistes working in India was sparked off following the September 18 Uri attack which killed 19 Indian soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack was followed by surgical attacks that India conducted across the LoC.

Earlier, while MNS issued an ultimatum to Pakistani artistes to quit India, the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association passed a resolution asking producers to avoid working with talent from Pakistan.

Then, the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India announced single screen theatres in Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat won't screen ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"". MNS has been open about condemning the idea of releasing of the movie

However, theatre chain owners have now come forward in support of the film.

Anil Thadani, owner of distribution house AA Films, Alok Tandon, CEO, INOX Leisure Ltd and Arvind Chapalka, owner of City Pride multiplexes in Pune, among others are all supporting the release of ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" and ready to screen it.

This is not the first time ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" has been in the news.

The film, which will clash with Ajay Devgn's ""Shivaay"" at the box office on October 28, earlier made headlines when the actor-filmmaker alleged that Johar paid controversial actor Kamaal R.

Hitting out at the Uttar Pradesh CM, Rupani said that Akhilesh Yadav had made the remarks out of of âfrustrationâ. 
âI think Akhilesh Yadav is frustrated as he can see that his party is losing the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election,â Rupani said. 
Rupani also accused Yadav of insulting Gujarat and said speaking about the advertisement during his election campaign was ânot even relevantâ, according to India Today. 
The Gujarat Chief Minister also hit out at Yadav for dragging Amitabh Bachchan's name into the political fight for Uttar Pradesh. 
Rupani's remarks came hours after Akhilesh took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for attacking his government over advertisement expenditure in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and dragged superstar Amitabh Bachchan, saying he should stop advertising the âdonkeys of Gujaratâ. 
âEk gadhe ka vigyapan aata hai, main iss sadi ke sabse bade mahanayak se kahunge ke ab aap Gujarat ke gadhon ka prachar mat kariye (There is an advertisement about donkeys. I want to tell the countryâs biggest superstar to stop advertising the donkeys of Gujarat),â 
Yadav said this whil addressing a rally in Raebareli on Monday. 
The latest advertisement of Gujarat Tourism talks about donkeys and features Amitabh Bachchan. 
Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu also hit out at Yadav saying the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister was disturbed and, hence, was making such âderogatory statementsâ. 
Addressing the media on Monday, Naidu said that Akhilesh by making such statements, Yadav was insulting the people of Gujarat. âHe is disturbed hence using such language and making such comments. He is insulting the people of Gujarat. I donât know from where this âdonkey comment came in betweenâ,â said Naidu.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav 's ""Gujarat ke Gadhe (Donkeys of Gujarat)"" jibe might have been meant to score points in a bitter electoral battle, but it has inadvertently sharpened focus on the Indian wild ass, promoted in a TV spot by no less than megastar Amitabh Bachchan in his capacity as the state's brand ambassador. 
In fact, the conservation of the species (Equus hemionus Khur), which is found only in Gujarat - having been rendered extinct in south India, Pakistan and Afghanistan - has earned the state plaudits from wildlife experts. 
""The conservation of the Indian wild ass is an exemplary success story for the world to follow. The Gujarat government has, over the years, done a great job,"" Wildlife Institute of India (WII) Director VB Mathur said. 
Mathur, along with experts like Nita Shah, also of the WII, have worked on conserving the species for 22 years, back from the time when it was on the verge of extinction. Today, the animal numbers well over 4,500 in the wild. 
Mathur believed that the change in the farming pattern due to better irrigation has also helped in the conservation. 
""It's a unique animal... What's commendable is that that the local government managed to balance the conservation of the species and development of the region,"" Mathur added. 
Shekhar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network that works in alliance with the WWF, said the species still faces several challenges for its survival. 
""It's one of those rare examples where both the species and its habitat are troubled. It is still threatened but its population has gone up in Gujarat,"" Niraj told IANS. 

The natural habitat of Indian wild ass is Rann of Kutch, where the animals are also referred to as ""Riders and Guardians of the Rann"" for their ability to run at speeds of over 60 km per hour. 
The species, whose body frame matches that of a horse, is a sub-species of the near-threatened Asiatic wild ass (Equus heminous) that is now found only in small patches in India, Iran, Turkmenistan and Mongolia. 
According to government records, the Indian wild ass was on the verge of extinction around 1970 due to lack of conservation efforts and a prevalent epidemic. 
Experts said that conservation efforts by the state, central government and IUCN had helped increase the numbers of the species. 
A census in 2014 counted 4,451 animals spread over 15,000 sq km in Gujarat. This was 454 more than the count of the 2009 census. The present population is estimated at over 4,800. 
Thus, it's little wonder that experts have objected to the animal being depicted as a pejorative. 
""It's not right to drag the endangered species into political feuds because it affects the conservation efforts. We should rather feel proud the species could be saved and now attracts tourists from across the world,"" V.P Singh, a Uttar Pradesh-based wildlife conservator, said. 
WHAT THEN IS THE FUSS ALL ABOUT? 
Akhilesh Yadav, speaking at a rally on Monday, pointed to the TV spot - obliquely referring to Bachchan - to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah. 
""An advertisement is there on donkeys. I urge the biggest actor of the century not to advertise donkeys of Gujarat,"" Yadav said. 
The advertisement promotes Gujarat's Wild Ass Wildlife Sanctuary, one of the largest in the nation. 
Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said Akhilesh Yadav, had insulted the state with his remarks. 
But then, without perhaps realising he was doing so, Akhilesh was only paying Modi back in his own coin. 
During the campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi had sneered at the Lion Safari, a dream project of Akhilesh Yadav to introduce the Asiatic lions (native to Gujarat) in his home town of Safai. 
Modi had then wondered how the state government could take care of lions when ""they had not been able to take care of (people of) the state"". 
Eight Asiatic lions were bought to Safai between April and October 2014 from Gujarat and Hyderabad zoos and more followed later. However, four of those and five newborn cubs had died by June 2016.

Akhilesh Yadavâs âdonkeyâ remark targeting the Prime Minister triggered a sharp reaction from the Gujarat BJP, which accused the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister of âinsultingâ the people of the western state. 
The BJP leaders in the home state of Narendra Modi also took a swipe at Akhilesh over his tussle for power with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, saying that unlike him, donkeys are loyal and he should learn from the animal. 
âAkhilesh Yadav, by appealing to Amitabh Bachchan that he should not âcampaign for the donkeysâ of the state, has insulted Gujarat,â state BJP chief Jitu Vaghani said. 
Mr. Akhilesh on Monday targeted Mr. Modi and BJP president Amit Shah as he âappealedâ to Bachchan not to âcampaign for the donkeys of Gujaratâ. Bachchan is the brand ambassador of Gujarat Tourism. 
âThe UP Chief Minister is facing defeat in his state but that does not give him a licence to insult people of Gujarat,â Vaghani said. 
BJP leaders also taunted the UP CM saying he does not know the difference between wild asses, which are found in Gujarat, and donkeys. 
âBachchan (who belongs to Uttar Pradesh and whose wife is a Samajwadi Party MP) is a superstar and is well-known all over the world. By becoming brand ambassador of Gujarat Tourism, he has helped in growth of tourism. This only shows Akhileshâs jealousy on the progress Gujarat has made,â he added. 
Mr. Vaghani also asked the Congress, which has tied up with the Samajwadi Party in UP, if that party endorses Mr. Akhileshâs remark. 
BJP spokesperson Harshad Patel said, âDonkeys are loyal to their owners. Akhilesh should learn from donkeys to stay loyal to his father. He has nothing to say about development work done by his government so he is trying to rake up non-existent issues.â 
BJP youth leader Amit Thakkar, also director of Gujarat Tourism Corporation, said that Akhilesh does not know the difference between donkeys and wild asses. 
âWild asses, called âGhudkharâ in local parlance, are a different species from donkeys, and are uniquely found in Gujarat only. Gujarat has a dedicated sanctuary for them. 
However, I donât expect a UP leader to understand the difference,â Mr. Thakkar said.

""We are thankful to the EC, it has given a just order. I congratulate workers and leaders of Samajwadi Party and urge them to work towards electing Akhilesh as Chief Minister yet another time,"" Yadav, who has been a staunch supporter of the Chief Minister through the intra-party conflict, said.

The order said Mulayam Singh's side did not file any affidavit of MPs or MLAs or any delegates claiming allegiance to it with the SP supremo maintaining that there was no split in the party needing determination of a dispute. 
In the last Lok Sabha polls in 2014, it won only 5 seats. All winning candidates belonged to Mulayam's family. West Bengal Socialist Party of Kiranmoy Nanda merged with SP, which has two MLAs in Bihar and one each in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal. 
Nanda had presided over the December 1 convention which anointed Akhilesh as new Samajwadi Party president in place of Mulayam. 
There was simmering discontent within the ruling family ever since Akhilesh became the Chief Minister. Mulayam's younger brother Shivpal was not in favour of Akhilesh as Chief Minister. 
When the battle lines were drawn and last gasp efforts began for control over the party, the SP got clearly divided into two camps with one led by Akhilesh and Ramgopal Yadav, Mulayam's cousin, and the other by the Yadav chieftain himself. Mulayam had the backing of Shivpal and friend Amar Singh, often described as an ""outsider"" and blamed for the rift in the family. 
Akhilesh had fired his uncle Shivpal twice from the cabinet and it was seen by many as a direct challenge to his father, who steadily showed preference for his younger brother over son. 
The battle in the family took a decisive turn when Akhilesh released a parallel list of 235 candidates for the state assembly polls. 
Mulayam and Shivpal had already released a list of 325 candidates in the absence of Akhilesh which did not go down well with the Chief Minister who wanted a decisive say in selecting the nominees. 
Simmering tension in the state's ruling party erupted into a full-fledged war on December 30, 2016, when Mulayam expelled Akhilesh and Ramgopal Yadav from the party for six years on grounds of indiscipline but reinstated them within 24 hours after a meeting of 200 of the party?s 229 MLAs at the Chief Minister's residence. 
At the SP National Convention on January 1 called by Ram Gopal, Akhilesh Yadav was declared the national president of Samajwadi Party. 
Naresh Chandra Uttam was named chief of SP's state unit by Akhilesh replacing Shivpal. 
In the mean time, Mulayam expelled Ramgopal again for six years for the third time in six months. 
Those expelled for attending the convention included vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda and state general secretary Naresh Agarwal, a Rajya Sabha MP. 
As the tussle for controlling the party organisation continued, both the factions knocked the Election Commission's door claiming to be the ""real"" Samajwadi Party and seeking the 'bicycle' symbol. 
In its today's order, the EC said, ""The commission hereby answers the issue by holding that the group led by Akhilesh Yadav is the Samajwadi Party and is entitled to use its name and its reserved symbol bicycle for the purposes of the Election symbols (Reservation and Allotment) order 1968,"" formally ending Mulayam's control over the party he founded.

""Last week our army showed valour and avenged the deaths of 19 soldiers killed in the Uri attack. I may have differences with the Prime Minister over a 100 issues. But when he has shown the will (to deal with this matter), I salute him,"" he said.

In a series of tweets, the actor said youths should raise their voice peacefully. He said this was the only way to achieve the promised SCS in Andhra Pradesh.
The opposition parties and other groups have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of betraying the state by backtracking from its poll promise of according SCS.
They also targeted the ruling Telugu Desam Party for ""compromising"" on the issue.
Pawan Kalyan, who had been targeting the BJP and TDP for months, continued his attacks.
""The muscle called courage and the qualities -- self respect, integrity and accountability are lacking in the political class of Andhra Pradesh,"" he tweeted.
""We love Gandhi, we adore Ambedkar, we salute Sardar Patel, we respect our Constitution but not the snobbish leadership of north India. If they go on humiliating people of south India and hurting their self-respect... we know how to bring down their snobbishness.
""Does the north Indian political elites know how many languages are there in the South? For them we are all Madrasis,"" Pawan added.
The Congress has said it was ready to join hands with any party to achieve SCS.
The Prathekya Hoda Sadhana Samithi, which is fighting for SCS, has asked the Telugu actor to learn a lesson from the Jallikattu protest and take a lead in achieving SCS.

325,PLTE008SRC002," The Jallikattu movement in Tamil Nadu seems to have become an inspiration for the people of Andhra Pradesh who have been for long demanding Special Status for the state. Drawing similarities with Marina beach protest of Chennai, the Andhra Pradesh youth has called for a silent protest on January 26, 2017, at Vishakhapatnamâs iconic RK Beach. 
The protest call gained momentum after Power star and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan extended his support. He said, ""Politicians who are high on business interests and low political commitment have denied AP its promised special status. I strongly believe its politicians who have compromised, but not the general public. If political class of AP had shown the same kind of solidarity, Andhra would have got its promised special status long back"". 
Andhra Pradeshâs principal opposition party, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), has also extended its support to the protest. YSRCP Chief Jagan Mohan Reddy has appealed youth to come forward, support and make the event a big success. 
The demand for Special Status for the Andhra Pradesh has even drawn the attention of Tollywood celebrities. Actor Sai Dharam Tej tweeted, ""Itâs time for us to be united and fight for what we were promised and deserve. #SilentProtest"" 
Actor Nikhil Siddhartha wrote on twitter, ""This is what I personally feel deep down as a normal person. Hope it is achieved peacefully #APDemandsSpecialStatus.â 
Actor Sharwanand tweeted, ""Come on Champs, Letâs do it together. #APDemandsSpecialStatus.â 
Political parties and people of Andhra Pradesh have been demanding Special status for the state for a very long time. However, Andhra Pradesh was only granted special package by Centre. 
The police have clarified that no protest will be allowed at RK Beach. Speaking to CNN News Vishakhapatnam Commissioner of Police said, ""On January 26, Republic Day celebrations will be taking place and in view of security concerns no protest will be allowed. Also, the call is on social media as of now. No permission has been sought and it will not be granted.""",POLITICS

Without taking Kalyan's name at a press conference here this afternoon, the Chief Minister asked ""why should we take up a Jallikattu-style agitation? What is the link between Jallikattu and SCS (securing special category)? Jallikattu is just a rural game. 
""I am tactfully and strategically going ahead. Have I compromised on anything? We have got special economic package akin to SCS, then why this fight now,"" Chandrababu questioned. 
""I will myself strongly fight if any injustice is done to the state,"" the Chief Minister asserted. 
""Will Andhras ever learn? If the political class of AP had shown this kind of solidarity, AP would have got its promised special category status long back. 
""But politicians, who are high on business interests and low on political commitment, have denied AP its promised special category status. But I strongly believe that it's only politicians who have compromised and not the general public. Jana Sena is with them (people),"" Kalyan said in a series of tweets two days ago, adding the ""Jallikattu agitation"" should be taken as an inspiration. 
Other opposition parties, too, echoed similar views. 
Congress member of Rajya Sabha K V P Ramachandra Rao wrote a letter to the Chief Minister, asking the latter to lead a movement for SCS. 
""If a movement is launched under your leadership, all political parties, media, industry, film industry and other sectors and intellectuals besides students and youth will follow you,"" he said. 
Following Kalyan's tweets, some youths announced they would take up a protest programme on the Visakhapatnam beach on Republic Day and the actor promptly extended his support.

333,PLTE011SRC001,"Backing the bull-taming sport of Jallikattu, which has now been banned in the state, Tamil superstar Kamal Haasan argued that the sport is symbolic of Tamil culture and he is a âbig fanâ of it. He also added he has himself played jallikattu many times. 
Speaking at the India Today South Conclave in Chennai, he said, âIf you want a ban on jallikattu, letâs also ban biryani.â 
He also asserted that Jallikattu doesnât cause physical harm to the animal unlike done in Spain where bulls die. He said that bulls are âtreated like godsâ in Tamil Nadu. He clarified, â It is about taming the bull and not creating physical harm by breaking its horns or other parts.â It was not the first time the actor has spoken about the controversial sport. Previously also, he has been quite vocal about restarting the âtraditionâ, constantly reiterating that the sport is not intended at harming the animal involved. Amidst growing support for the sport, the Tamil Nadu government has urged the Centre to consider promulgating an ordinance for âremoving the legal impedimentsâ to enable the conduct of the sport next week. Jallikattu was banned in Tamil Nadu by a 2014 Supreme Court order claiming the sport amounting to cruelty to animals. 
",POLITICS
334,PLTE011SRC002,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to revoke the ban Jallikattu in the state by passing an ordinance to ensure that the traditional sport, which is part of Pongal celebrations in the state, is allowed. 
""Given that Pongal festival, which holds great importance to the people of Tamil Nadu, is less than a week away and Jallikattu is an integral part of the Pongal festivities, and considering the urgency of the issue, Government of India should consider promulgating an ordinance removing the legal impediments, enabling the conduct of Jallikattu during Pongal, 2017,"" Panneerselvam wrote in the letter. 
The Supreme Court had banned the sport in Tamil Nadu on May 7, 2014 following severe backlash from animal rights activists. However, the Ministry of Environment and Forests allowed the sport to continue under certain conditions thereby ending the ban on January 8, 2016. But the apex court issued a stay on the sport on January 12, 2016, after hearing petitions by the Animal Welfare Board of India and then refused to lift the stay. 
What is Jallikattu ? 
Jallikattu, also known as Eruthazhuvuthal or Manju Virattu, is held in Tamil Nadu during the festival of Pongal. The sport, which is an integral part of the festivities in the state, was believed to be a common practice during the classical period (400-100 BC) in Tamil Nadu. 
The bulls are well-fed and are bred by the villagers before the event and attended mostly by several temple bulls in the villages. A temple bull is the head of all cattle in a village for whom special rituals are performed on important days. 
After the event is over, tamed weak bulls are used for domestic activities and agriculture while the strong ones are used for breeding. 
There are three versions of Jallikattu: Vadi Manju Virattu â This version is organised mostly in the districts of Madurai, Pudukkottai, Theni, Tanjore, and Tiruchirappalli. The bull is released onto the field through an opening in the enclosure following which an individual clings to the hump of the bull. The person has to cling to the hump for a specified period of time to win the prize. Only one individual can attempt at clinging to the bull. Vaeli Virattu â This version is organised mostly in the districts of Sivagangai, Tiruchirappalli, Manamadurai and Madurai. The bulls are not restricted in any manner and are free to run in any direction once released. Many do not come close to any humans. Most of the bulls just keeps its position and attack any person who comes near them. They play around for a few minutes to several hours thereby entertaining the crowd. Vadam Manjuvirattu â ""Vadam"" is the Tamil word for rope. The bull is tied to a 50-foot-long rope and is free to move within this space. A team of seven or nine members try to control the bull within 30 minutes. This is the safer version of the game since the bull is tied to a rope and there are barricades put up to protect the audience. 
How are the Jallikattu bulls trained ? 
The calves chosen for the sport will be fed a healthy and nutritious diet so that they grow into strong, well-developed bulls. They are also taken to the events once they reach adolescence to give them a feel of the atmosphere. Vadam Manjuvirattu bulls are given special training so that they understand the restraints of the rope. 
Why was Jallikattu banned ? 
Animal activists, the FIAPO (Federation of India Animal Protection Agencies) and PETA India had been protesting against Jallikattu since 2004. 
The Animal Welfare Board of India had also filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking a complete ban on Jallikattu because of the cruel treatment meted out to animals and also over the threat it pose to public safety. There are human injuries and fatalities involved due to which the Board sought a ban on the sport. Several bulls suffer injuries believed to be a bad omen for the village. 
The apex court ruled in favour of the ban on Jallikattu and bullock cart racing in the state saying that even bulls have rights against torture. 
""Forcing a bull and keeping it in the waiting area for hours and subjecting it to the scorching sun is not for the animal's well-being. Forcing and pulling the bull by a nose rope into the narrow, closed enclosure or 'vadi vassal' (entry point), subjecting it to all forms of torture, fear, pain and suffering by forcing it to go the arena and also over-powering it in the arena by bull tamers, are not for the well-being of the animal,"" the bench had said. 
The bench added that the Animal Welfare Board of India had also provided details on the ways in which the sport was organised saying that the torture and cruelty meted out to the bulls was unimaginable. ""Being dumb and helpless, they suffer in silence,"" it said. The court also said that cruelty towards the animal is obvious because they are not suited for such activities. Forcing them to participate in such events is making them go through unnecessary pain. 
The Bench, comprising Justices Dipak Misra and RF Nariman, said that humans did not have the right to negate their obligation just because animals cannot speak for themselves. ""We cannot import Roman Gladiator type sport here. One can use computer for indulging in bull fighting. Why tame bulls for it ,"" the bench said. 
",POLITICS
335,PLTE011SRC003,"The call for revocation of ban on Jallikattu intensified as the protestors took to the streets in Chennai on Sunday demanding that the ban on the bull taming sport be lifted at the earliest.
The protestors asked the Central Government to promulgate an ordinance so that the ancient sport is played again.
More than 5000 people gathered at Marina beach for a rally demanding Jallikattu to be conducted this year.
The protestors raised slogans against PETA and demanded government to act on their demands.
""We don't do anything to make the bull aggressive, it is their nature,"" one of the protestors told ANI.
He said that the Tamil Nadu Government should place an application to the Centre to pass an ordinance to conduct jallikattu.
Earlier in May 2014, the Supreme Court had banned the practice of Jallikattu, citing animal welfare issues.
The government later on January 8, 2016, passed an order exempting Jallikattu from all performances where bulls cannot be used, effectively reversing the ban.
The Supreme Court, however, in January last year refused to re-examine its 2014 judgement banning use of bulls for Jallikattu events or bullock-cart races across the country.
Jallikattu, also known Eruthazhuvuthal, is a bull-taming sport played in Tamil Nadu as a part of the Pongal harvest festival.

Nitish Kumar, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, and leaders of the Congress and opposition BJP participated in the human chain.
""More than three crore people participated in forming the chain that stretched for 11,400 km; it is more than expected. Huge participation of people made it clear that they support prohibition,"" a visibly upbeat Nitish Kumar told the media here.
He said participation of women in large numbers was remarkable. ""At several places, I was informed by officials, people made double human chains due to gathering of more people.""
Bihar Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh claimed the ""world's longest human chain of over 11,000 km"" was formed from 12.15 p.m. to 1 p.m. The previous record is of a 1,050 km human chain in Bangladesh in early 2000.
MPs, MLAs, party workers of both the ruling Grand Alliance of Janata Dal-United, RJD and the Congress as well as opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and Lok Janshakti Party held each other's hands to express support for prohibition.
Three satellites, including one foreign and two of Indian Space Research Organisation, four aircraft, two helicopters and 40 drones were used to obtain images of the human chain, officials said.
According to officials, hundreds of people stood in queues to form a map of Bihar at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna. 
A picture of a liquor bottle with a cross sign was drawn in the middle of the map to give the message against alcohol consumption.
Nearly 20 million people were expected to join hands across the state for the chain, the officials added.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar imposed the liquor ban in the state on April 5, 2016.

Addressing journalists outside the Coimbatore International Airport, she said that the BJP's support was for the people and it sensitive of the people's feelings. That was the reason that the Centre had in 2016 issued ordinance to conduct the sport. 
But, now, with the Supreme Court seized of the matter, it was impossible to take steps. If the Court were to deliver the verdict â one way or the other â the Government would do all that was within its powers to conduct jallikattu. 
It was with the hope that the Court would deliver the verdict before Pongal that the BJP had been saying that jallikattu would be conducted. Now that the verdict was reserved, the BJP could do little, she said. 
Ms. Soundararajan said that her statement and those of other leaders that jallikattu would be conducted notwithstanding the Court ban and in deference to people's wishes was akin to the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa staging a fast for the Cauvery cause. 
Blaming the Congress-DMK, she said that when the then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh included bulls in the list of performing animals, both the parties did little to protest against the inclusion. It was only after the BJP's then Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar took steps to remove the bull from the list, that the anti-jallikattu lobby moved the court. Therefore, it was wrong to blame the BJP. 
Ms. Soundararajan also sought a ban on PETA saying it had no business asking the President Pranab Mukherjee to not sign the ordinance, if the Centre were to promulgate to conduct jallikattu.

Her remarks have come in the wake of PETA writing to president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, urging that the TN government should be dismissed if the bull taming sport was conducted in the state defying the supreme court ban. BJP national secretary H Raja alleged that PETA was an agent of some big corporates in the United States of America. ""Those who support PETA in India are anti-nationals,"" he said. Stating that Tamil Nadu could not conduct Jallikattu by defying apex court order, ""But personally, I offer my full support to the sport, which is the tradition of Tamil Nadu. I am even ready to conduct Jallikattu."" He further said that the intention of PETA was to destroy the culture and tradition of India by changing the farm-based system. ""It intends to bring petroleum-based eco-system,"" he added. He had earlier said Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam were to be blamed for the ban on Jallikattu, it may be recalled.

Earlier, Mayawati had released her first list of 100 candidates on Thursday and today list carries names for assembly segments that go to the polls in the second (February 15) and third phase (February 19) of the stateâs staggered election. 
In this second list it includes candidates for Etawah and Mainpuri, the stronghold of arch rival the Samajwadi Party. V.K. Agarwal has been given ticket from Palia (Lakhimpur), Ramhet Bharti from Hargon, Mahesh Chandra Mishra from Maholi, retired IPS officer Gurbachan Lal from Puvaya, Mohd Aslam Khan from Shahjahanpur Sadar and Avdhesh Kumar Verma from Tilhar. 
Anees Ansari will be the BSP nominee from Bareilly City and Rajendra Prasad Gupta from Bareilly Cantt. Narendra Nath Chaturvedi has been fielded from Etawah, Durgesh Shakya (Jaswantnagar), Raghvendra Gautam (Bharthana), Mohd Umar Khan (Farukkhabad), Nitin Singh (Kannauj), Tahir Hussain (Chibramau), Vijay Singh (Tirwa) and Anurag Singh from Kannauj. 
Mayawati also declared candidates for Lucknow: Ajay Srivastava (Lucknow North), Arman Khan (Lucknow West), Saroj Shukla (Lucknow East) and Rajiv Srivastava (Lucknow Central). Maharaj Singh has been fielded from Mainpuri, the pocket borough of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.

352,PLTE019SRC002,"BSP chief Mayawati âs decision to field 97 Muslims â the highest ever by the party in Assembly elections â is being seen as a strategy to make the Dalit-Muslim combine its main poll plank, the same way the Dalit-Brahmin combine was the talking point of its successful 2007 poll campaign. 
The party on Friday announced its second list of candidates for 100 more Assembly seats, thereby declaring nominees for 200 of the 403 seats, with Muslims getting the lionâs share â a total of 58 aspirants in the two lists. While BSPâs first list of 100 candidates released on Thursday contained 36 Muslim candidates, Fridayâs list had names of 22 aspirants from the community, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the stateâs electorate. 
In 2007, Mayawati had wooed Brahmins in a big way, organising Brahmin conventions for nearly two years, with BSPâs Brahmin face Satish Chandra Misra emerging as a star campaigner. This time, the busiest campaigner for the party has been Naseemuddin Siddiqui, BSPâs general secretary and Muslim face. Along with his son Afzal, Siddiqui has held public meetings in the highest number of Assembly segments, most of them in Muslim-dominated western UP. 
Party sources say their 2007 campaign was against the âlawlessness under the Mulayam governmentâ, which had perturbed upper castes, especially Brahmins. Mayawati had based her campaign on the poll plank of eradicating that lawlessness, coining the slogan, âChadh gundon ki chhati par, button dabao hathi parâ, attracting not just Brahmins but also other upper castes. 
This time, she has trained her guns at the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi , repeatedly saying that Dalits and Muslims were facing equal discrimination under the BJP governments, citing the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri and flogging of Dalits in Una in the name of cow protection. 
The dispute between Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav over control of the Samajwadi Party is also being seen by BSP as an opportunity to present itself as the only option to defeat BJP. 
âWith BJP likely to emerge as our principal opponent this time, the upper castes are not as likely to vote for us as they were in 2007. BSP has been opposing the policies of the Modi government more strongly than any other party. Muslims will vote for us because we are not only giving voice to their concerns, but also giving them the largest share of tickets,â said a senior leader.

The third list of Bahujan Samaj Party released on Saturday has a dominance of Muslims and dalits, who comprise 49 out of 100 names. In all, over 80 Muslim candidates have already got the party tickets with the last list expected on Sunday. As per the caste-wise break up of candidates revealed by party chief Mayawati last Tuesday, BSP has decided to field 97 Muslims and 87 Dalits of 403 allocating the rest 113 to upper castes (66 brahmins and 36 kshatriyas) and 106 to OBCs. The first list announced on Thursday had 37 Muslim candidates followed by 21 in the second and 27 in the current list. Muslims constitute almost 19% of the total population of UP and enjoy a decisive vote in almost 125 of 403 seats across the state. Similarly, the party is contemplating to filed 87 Dalit candidates. While 16 dalits were given tickets in the first list for western UP, 27 made it to the second list for Rohilkhand and Central UP regions. However, the party has decide to filed as many as 22 Dalits on the remaining Central UP including Unnao, Barabanki, Rae Bareli, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh and Allahabad besides Bundelkhand seats including Jalaun, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot, etc. The most prominent name in the third list released on Saturday was that of partyâs state unit chief Ram Achal Rajbhar who will contest election from Akbarpur seat in Ambedkarnagar district. Meanwhile, ahead of sharing the third list of 100 party candidates, the BSP chief convened a high-level meeting of senior party leaders and all the 403 party candidates in the state capital on Saturday. Taking a lead over other parties, BSP had decided tickets to all the 403 party candidates much in advance. The names of the final candidates were already spelt out to district level party units and those, who got the ticket, had started working in their respective constituencies. Addressing the state unit party workers, the BSP chief took the update of party's poll preparedness and also directed the party cadre to follow the code of conduct enforced by the Election Commission. Discussing the details of the model code of conduct, the BSP chief asked the partymen to follow it in letter and spirit without exception in order to keep the partyâs image as a disciplined party intact. Spelling out party's campaign strategy to those present in the meeting, Mayawati exhorted the party workers to continue organising small district level meetings to strike a direct connect with the voters. She also shared broader points on which with party's chief campaigners were expected to focus pushing them to target Modi government over non-fulfillment of promises during last two and half years. She also asked them to raise the issue of proposed Parliament session from January 31 and union budget presentation on February 1, 2017 with the motive to woo the voters in poll bound states with populist schemes. The BSP cadre was also asked to focus on the ongoing family feud in SP apart from the alleged failure of Akhilesh government on all the fronts including law and order.

Speaking to media persons after paying tributes to Head Constable Ramashankar Yadav, who was killed by the activists while escaping from the Bhopal Central Jail on Monday, Chouhan said he was pained to see that certain politicians were making a ""hue and cry over the terrorists but not saying a word of solace for the martyred policemen.""

""I am pained to see the kind of politics being played out. Some politicians are turning a blind eye to the sacrifices of the martyrs. They are unable to see theÂ sacrifice of Ramashankar Yadav. These were the same terrorists who first killed Shivpratap Kushwaha (policeman) in Ratlam and then they murdered Sitaram Yadav (policeman) in Khandwa and now Ramashankar Yadav.

""...had there been some solidarity and sympathy for the martyred jawans...I would have understood. But, they are playing vote-bank politics over incidents like these,"" he told reporters.

The CM added that those killed were ""dreaded terrorists who could have wreaked devastation if they had been fully successful in escaping.""

""Certain politicians are making a hue and cry for these terrorists but not lending a word of solace for the martyred jawans. I condemn such leaders and the dirty politics they are doing. But for the government and the public the nation and the state is foremost and I appeal everyone to stop playing dirty politics. Patriotism is important,"" he said.

Chouhan said Yadav tried to ""single-handedly"" fight the terrorists and stop them from escaping"" and being a ""dutiful officer"" he laid down his life in the line of duty.

""This is such a patriotic family from where two sons are still serving to protect the country's borders,"" he said, underling the fact that Yadav's two sons are in the army.

He said the state government will ""take care"" of the family and has announced a Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia for Yadav's family and another Rs 5 lakh for the marriage of his daughter which is slated in December this year.

""This colony where he (Yadav) lived will be named Shaheed Ramashankar Yadav colony and a statue of his will also be installed. Funds are not a constraint and more aid and money will be provided to the family when it is required,"" the CM added.

'Why do only Muslims break out of jail and not Hindus?'

Questioning the authenticity of the encounter video, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday wondered as to what is the reason that only Muslims break out of jail and not Hindus while stating that he was against all those playing politics in the name of religion.

The Congress general secretary stated that he had put ban on the SIMI when he was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.

""I was the first Chief Minister to put ban on the SIMI. Rajnath Singh was then the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh...he did not put the ban. Other controvertist Hindu organisations like the Bajrang Dal along with the SIMI used to ensure that riots take place. I had proofs and based on that the NDA put the ban on SIMI,"" he told ANI in an exclusive conversation.

""I don't have love either for SIMI or Bajrang Dal. I am against all those who create ruckus and play politics in the name of religion. Owaisi ji is also included in that,"" he added.

The Congress leader stated that the cases of the SIMI terrorists were taken back in 2011 during the BJP's rule in Madhya Pradesh.

""Some SIMI terrorists escaped from jail in Khandwa in 2013. In 2014, the Madhya Pradesh Chief Secretary was informed that they may attempt to run away from the jail. On October 31, 2016, eight SIMI terrorists ran away from jail. Now, what is the reason that only Muslims break out of jail and not Hindus,"" he added.",POLITICS

Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad(ABVP) activists clashed with police and All India Students' Association (AISA) workers at Delhi University's Ramjas college protesting against the invite extended to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. 
On Tuesday, Delhi Universityâs Ramjas College had called off a seminar after members from the studentsâ union protested the participation of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. Khalid was booked for sedition last year for allegedly raising anti-India slogans during an Afzal Guru event at the JNU campus. 
The students had failed to inform Delhi Police and the police only arrived at the venue after being alerted by college authorities, according to media reports.

The protests were triggered a day after ABVP protested violently against a seminar where Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) research scholar Umar Khalid and former JNU Studentsâs Union (JNUSU) vice-president Shehla Rashid were scheduled to speak at Ramjas College. The police had allegedly informed the College that they would be âunable to provide securityâ for Khalid at the event.

A video of Tuesdayâs events, that has gone viral on social media, shows stones being pelted at the College allegedly by ABVP activists. Professors in Ramjas College had claimed that Khalid was invited due to his âacademic credentialsâ. Police had to cordon off the College. 
On Wednesday, a protest march was organised at 1 pm from Ramjas College to Maurice Nagar police station to protest against the ABVPâs actions. The protests turned ugly as the ABVP clashed with agitating students. A journalist covering the event was also manhandled during the clashes. 
Shehla Rashid claimed that the police did not react when the ABVP activists allegedly turned violent. âThe police are giving protection to the ABVP. We were lathi-charged even though we were protesting peacefully. ABVP was pelting stones and Delhi Police was standing silently,â she said.

âOver the past two-and-half years, the number of incidents of communal tensions have gone down substantially.

âWe want such incidents to be zero. We are working on that,â he said in remarks which come on the eve of completion of one year since the lynching of Mohammad Aqlakh in Uttar Pradeshâs Dadri over suspicion of beef consumption.

The Minister of State for Minority Affairs said it was a âvery unfortunateâ incident and an act of people âwho are bent on dividing communitiesâ.

âBut there has been no repeat of such incident over the past one year,â he said.

The Ministers was responding to queries from reporters on the sidelines of launch of Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) at the annual conference of state channelising agencies of National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC).

The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had come under attack over the September 28, 2015 killing of 50-year-old Aqlakh with some Union Ministers and BJP MPs making controversial statement regarding it. The incident also led to a section of artistes and litterateurs returning their awards in protest against the alleged intolerance.

Naqvi did not specify the data on communal incidents, but stated that there is an âatmosphere of confidence and developmentâ among all including minorities and added the governmentâs agenda of development can only âdefeat the agenda of destructionâ.

He also defended Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs reported âparishkritâ remark relating to Muslims, which has stoked a controversy, saying that the PM was right in asserting that there should be âno appeasement, but empowermentâ of the community members.

âPrime Minister has said it rightly. He has said that appeasement of minorities should be stopped and work on their empowerment should begin in the spheres of education and employment,â Naqvi said.

Modi had while addressing BJPâs national council in Kerala recently had quoted party ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay while reaching out to Muslism to say, âdonât reward, donât rebuke them; but empower themâ.

Naqvi said that only politics of development will work in the country and not of vote bank.

âMinorities, especially those from Muslim communities have remained below poverty line over these years. I donât think the so-called secular merchants of vote politicians ever discussed it. Today, we need to eliminate poverty and unemployment. We are trying to help them through different institutes,â he added.

During his speech at inaugural session of the conference, Naqvi said that more concerted efforts are required for creating awareness among target groups about the schemes and programmes of NMDFC.

He also stressed on the need for simplifying the procedures and reducing the waiting time for sanctioning of loans given by the financial body.

AADHAR and KYC norms for selection of beneficiaries, self-attestation of certificates by applicants and direct transfer of loan in the bank account of beneficiary are some of the steps taken by NMDFC to make implementation of its schemes more transparent and hassle free for the beneficiaries.

Speaking to The Indian Express, he said that the dalits took outÂ foot-marches, held public meetings and submitted memoranda to the stateÂ government through different channels but the state government remained quiet on the demand of dalits.

âAfter the state government turned a deaf ear to our demands, weÂ decided to organise a ârail rokoâ and that too, in an area which wasÂ represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his chief ministership.Â The Maninagar Railway Station falls in Maninagar assembly constituencyÂ which was represented by Modi,â said Mevani.

372,PLTE027SRC001,"In a bizarre development, Bollywood blockbuster Dangalâs teen star from Kashmir Zaira Wasim Khan on Monday took to social networking site Facebook to tender public apology over her recently meeting Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti, the engagement which had evoked severe criticism back home and she was trolled extensively and openly accused of socializing with âkillersâ of Kashmirâs young boys and girls.
However, she later deleted her post and said she was upset that it had âbeen turned into national news.â Incidentally, it happened on a day when the Chief Minister while winding up the discussion on Motion of Thanks on the Governorâs address in the State Legislative Council referred to her meeting with Zaira and said that girls like her should be encouraged for they are the âreal startsâ of the people. Ms. Mufti also said, âWhen it comes to talent, youngsters from Jammu and Kashmir are next to none and we must celebrate them and not those who post their photos on Facebook with guns in their hands.â
Zairaâs Facebook post in response to criticism of her on social media sites read, âThis is an open confession/ apology. I know that many people have been offended and displeased by my recent actions or by the people I have recently met.â She added that she wanted to apologise to all those who she may have hurt âunintentionallyâ.
Zaira, a resident of Srinagar, had met the Chief Minister last week and a photograph released by the government through the State Information Department showed her wearing traditional embroidered Kashmiri pheran (woollen cloak) while sitting with Ms. Mufti. A handout issued following the meeting had said that the Chief Minister enquired from Zaira about her education and interest in other creative fields like acting. âThe young actor briefed the Chief Minister about the film and the rigorous schedules she had had to follow while performing her roleâ, it said adding that her parents and some officials were also present during the meeting.
Zaira who played the role of wrestler Geeta Phogat in the recently released Amir Khan starrer movie and has been signed up for his next production Secret Superstar termed her actions as ânot deliberateâ. She hoped that she would be forgiven for her âunintentionalâ actions. She also said that people should stop calling her role-model of youngsters. âThere are a few more things which are very important and I want to clear them as well. The first and foremost thing is that Iâm being projected as a role-model for Kashmiri youth. I want to make it clear that I donât want anyone to follow in my footsteps or even consider me as a role-model. Iâm not proud of what Iâm doing and I want everyone, especially the youth to know that there are real role models out there whether they be in this time or in our history.â
In obvious reference to the bloodshed witnessed in Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of militant commander Burhan Waniâs killing in July last years, she said that she understood the sentiments of those she had âunintentionally hurt ...especially considering that what had happened over the last six monthsâ. She, however, also said, âBut I hope people can also understand there are certain circumstances that emerge which one cannot control and I hope people still remember that I'm a just a 16 year old girl and I hope you treat me accordingly.â
Three hours after posting her apology on Facebook, Zaira deleted it and urged the media and others not to blow it out of proportion. She wrote on her Facebook timeline, âDon't blow this out of proportion...Iâve not been forced into anything by anyone.â A short while later, she deleted this update too.

What are we coming to,â Mr. Abdullah wrote on the social networking site Twitter.com. Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, âZaira is indeed a good actress.

16-year-old Zaira first posted an apology for ""offending"" and ""unintentionally hurting"" people after her meeting with Mehbooba kicked up a row and trolled online but later deleted the post. She then posted again, this time asking everyone not to blow the issue out of proportion but deleted this post too. 

Zaira, who played the younger version of wrestler Geeta Phogat in ""Dangal"", took to Facebook and tendered an apology apparently over her meeting with the chief minister on Saturday that drew sharp reactions from the youth in the Valley because of the situation there during the last few months. 

She also played down her performance in ""Dangal"", saying she was ""not proud of"" what she is doing. 

""This is an open confession/apology. I know that many people have been offended and displeased by my recent actions or by the people I have recently met,"" the actress wrote on her Facebook page. 

Zaira said she wanted to apologise to ""all those people who I have unintentionally hurt and I want them to know that I understand their sentiments behind it especially considering that what had happened over the past six months"" - apparently referring to the unrest in the Valley which left 86 people dead and thousands injured. 

""But I hope people can also understand there are certain circumstances that emerge which one cannot control and I hope people still remember that I'm a just a 16 year old girl and I hope you treat me accordingly. I'm sorry for what I did but it was not a deliberate decision and I really hope people can forgive me,"" she said. 

Zaira also played down her projection as a role model for the youth of Kashmir, saying she does not want anyone to follow in her footsteps. 

""There are few more things which are very important and I want to clear them as well. The first and foremost thing is that I am being projected as a role model for Kashmiri Youth. I want to make it very clear that I do not want anyone to follow in my footsteps or even consider me as a role model. 

Zaira later removed her first post and came up with a new one, where she claimed that she has ""not been forced into anything by anyone"". She, however, deleted that too after sometime.

""A 16 year old shouldn't be forced to apologise & that too allegedly for meeting @MehboobaMufti. What are we coming to ,"" he tweeted. 

""I've a problem with @MehboobaMufti trying to usurp other peoples success to cover up her own failures but why punish/troll people she meets?,"" he added.

Winding up the discussion on motion of thanks on governor's address to Joint houses of Legislature, Mehbooba also referred to Zaira's ""excellent role"" in ""Dangal"", and said, ""our children are showing excellence in the fields of sports and others but unfortunately they don't get the due opportunity and appreciation"".",POLITICS

381,PLTE030SRC001,"No religion encourages its followers to make illegal religious structures or offer prayers in illegal shrines built on public property, said the Bombay High Court on Saturday.

""Therefore, we expect that no religion/sect or religious/political leader will oppose the demolition of illegal religious structures built after September 2009,"" said a division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Amjad Sayed directing the state to complete the action by end of December.

A bench clearly spelt out that the government, even after issuing a resolution in 2011 to take action against identified illegal shrines, has not gone ahead with its decision. ""It's been almost five and half years since the notification was issued by the government and still no implementation has taken place. All the directions issued subsequently show that they have remained on paper,"" said the bench.

The bench also noted that the government has limited itself in identifying the illegal shrines to public streets including footpaths and roads and no action has been taken against illegal shrines on public properties. Thus, the state has been directed to identify illegal religious structures built on public property, issue a government resolution (GR) by March and thereafter setting out an outer limit for demolition.

The court, while holding the demolition of illegal religious structures built on footpaths as legal, referred to its earlier judgement, which held that obstruction on public roads and pavements by illegal

structures was in violation of the Fundamental Rights of Citizens. It added that the right guaranteed to practise one's religion cannot be allowed at any and every place.

The bench has also asked the police commissioners and deputy superintendents of each district to provide necessary police protection to the staff in charge of demolition of illegal religious structures and to initiate prosecution under various laws against those persons who have built them or try to obstruct demolition work.

The court gave the direction while hearing a public interest litigation filed by an NGO, Society for Fast Justice, seeking implementation of the GR issued in 2011 against illegal shrines. The court has asked the government to file a compliance report on the action taken by it every month.

As per the government resolution issued in November 2015, the illegal shrines will be demolished within six months. Pursuant to an interim order of Supreme Court, a GR of May 5, 2011, and another one in 2015, had prescribed a ""well-defined"" scheme for appropriate action against unauthorised religious structures in terms of regularisation, relocation and removal. The GR also suggested that a three-tier committee be set up â statewise, district level and in corporations, including Mumbai, Thane and Pune â for relevant action.

The GR also said that illegal and unauthorised shrines erected after September 29, 2009, had to be demolished. Illegal religious shrines before September 2009 had been classified into categories, including old religious shrines, those that can be relocated and those are illegal.

As per statistics, in corporation limits 871 illegal structures were erected after September 2009 and only 225 among them have been demolished. In other parts of the state, there are 847 illegal religious shrines and only 159 of them have been demolished.",POLITICS

The HC also asked the police commissioners of Mumbai and other cities to provide adequate protection to the civic staff during the demolition.

Following the government's plea seeking three months to implement the order, the bench directed the state to demolish by December 31 all religious structures that have already been identified as ""illegal"".

The bench also asked the government to direct the committees appointed by it (the government) earlier at various levels to identify any other illegal shrines in their respective areas before March 31, 2017.

If any political leader tried to interfere in the demolition, the government should set the law in motion against such persons, the HC said.

""No religion allows worship at any shrine which is illegally built. We propose to issue a writ of mandamus to the state government against allowing illegal shrines to come up on public lands,"" the bench said.

On Saturday, an HC bench of justices Abhay Oka and Amjad Sayed issued directives on PILs for implementation of the SC order.Earlier, a May 5, 2011 state government resolution divided illegal shrines before the SC's cut-off date into three categories âthose to be regularized, demolished and relocatedâwhile those after the date were not to be protected. Following an HC directive to come out with a concrete programme, a November 18, 2015 GR outlined nine months to remove illegal shrines after the cut-off and two years to remove illegal shrines set up before it. Since the nine-month deadline expired in August, the state had sought a three-month extension.But the bench noted: ""The period has already expired in which admittedly not even one-third of the illegal structures have been demolished"". Also, there is hardly any implementation of the May 2011 GR and ""there are a large number of illegal religious structures not only on the streets, but also on public property.""The judges said while a recent state government affidavit claimed substantial progress, statistics proved otherwise(see box). They noted both the state and BMC had identified illegal shrines on public streets, footpaths and footways, not on government land and public property. The HC gave the state time till March 31, 2017, to identify and classify illegal religious structures on public properties.The judges said if illegal religious structures are allowed to be constructed on streets including footpaths and footways, it will infringe on the fundamental right under Article 21 to have streets in a reasonable condition. Also, protection under Article 25 (Right to Religion) ""will not be available unless proved that offering prayer or worship is essential by specific significance of that place"".The bench said no religion encourages its followers to erect illegal shrines or even worship in them. ""Therefore we are sure no religion or sect or religious leader will oppose the act of demolition of illegal shrines,"" it added. The judges also pointed out GRs reflect the state government's policy. ""There is no reason why a political party or political leader should oppose implementation of the GRs,"" they added.

Senior lawyer Kapil Sibal is present from Akhilesh Yadavâs side while advocate Mohan Parasaran and others are with Mulayam Singh Yadavâs group. 
After family feud, the factions led by Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had approached the poll body staking claim over the party and the symbol. Both sides had also submitted some documents to further their claim. 
The Commission wants to settle the matter before 17th of this month when the process of nomination begins for the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. 
The âCycleâ symbol faces the threat of being frozen before the Assembly polls, if the Election Commission is not able to decide which of the two factions commands majority in the organisation. 
Reports say, the side which has the support of more than half of the total MPs, MLAs, MLCs and delegates will gain an upper hand in the fight to control the party.

Earlier on Friday, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav , his brother Shivpal Yadav and leaders of Akhilesh Yadavâs camp such as Ram Gopal Yadav and Naresh Aggarwal arrived at the office of Election Commission in New Delhi for the hearing. 
Both the camps have staked claim to the party symbol for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. Ram Gopal, who has been in the Akhilesh camp, had submitted affidavits of party MLAs, MPs and MLCs proving allegiance to the chief minister. At the same time, Mulayam has reiterated that he remains the party president and said he wants the party united. 
Till EC gives a judgment, candidates from both Akhilesh and Mulayam camps cannot fight election on the basis of âcycleâ symbol at the same time.

The poll panel on Friday reserved its order on the claim of both the factions of the Samajwadi party over symbol Cycle. As Utter Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav and the embattled leader of SP Mulayam Singh Yadav have been caught in a tug of war for the last couple of weeks, sources claimed that Mulayam almost gave in on Friday accepting that Akhilesh is the CM and he is only âmargdarshakâ. 
Both the camps argued before the Election Commission to stake claim over 'cycle' election symbol as the poll body reserved its order on the issue. Officials said that a judgement will be delivered at the earliest as the process of filing nominations for the phase one of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will begin on January 17. 
Sources said that during the hearing in EC, Mulayam Singh Yadav said, âI am margdarshak, not chief.â Downplaying the entire SP feud, Singh also said that these issues are partyâs internal matter. 
Appearing for Akhilesh Yadav, senior counsels Rajeev Dhavan and Kapil Sibal argued before the Commission that majority of the MPs, MLAs, MLACs and party delegates are with the Uttar Pradesh CM. 
The hearing went on for over 4 hours and senior SP leaders including rival cousins Mulayam Singh and Ramgopal and Shivpal were present. Ramgopal was with Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agarwal. 
Citing past precedents, Election Symbol Order of 1968 and provisions of the Representation of the People Act, including Section 29A, the Akhilesh camp argued that since the numbers are stacked in favour of the CM, the symbol should go to him. 
But the Mulayam camp, represented by the senior advocate and former Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran said since there is ""no vertical split in the party such as SP (Mulayam) and SP (Akhilesh), the Commission lacks jurisdiction to allocate symbol to one of the groups. 
The EC may come out with an interim order if it is unable to decide on the case before January 17 as the process of filing nominations for the first phase of UP polls will begin on that day. 
After the split in the party last week, the factions led by Mulayam and his son Akhilesh had approached the Commission staking claim over the party and the symbol 'cycle'. Both the sides had also submitted voluminous documents to further their claim. 
With the notification, the process of filing nominations will begin. Candidates from Mulayam and Akhilesh camps cannot fight the election using the cycle symbol at the same time, therefore, the EC will have to take a call on the issue before that date.

Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said the exhibition of films is guided not by the âgoonsâ of any organisation but by the Cinematographic Act that permits screening after clearance by the Censor Board. It was the duty, he said, of State governments to uphold the law and ensure that films that had the necessary official clearances could be screened, while maintaining law and order.

The MNS agitation over the movie might have been seen as another display of the in-vogue macho neo-nationalism. But thatâs not the case.

Like the late Bal Thackeray, the Shiv Sena founder, Raj is fond of Bollywood and has more personal friends â including the Khan troika â there than in the political arena. So thereâs much more to the controversy over Karan Joharâs movie.

The issue has a direct co-relation to the upcoming election season in the state which has pitted the ruling BJP against its alliance partner, the Shiv Sena. Though the BJP and Shiv Sena have been sharing power, the latter has become one of the most bitter critics of the BJP. The Senaâs effort is to claim the opposition space too, thanks to the ineffective NCP and lacklustre Congress. The Sena thinks that by doing this, it can insulate itself from the anti-incumbency that comes with power. But its âhave-the-cake-and-eat-it-tooâ approach has irked and humiliated the BJP.

For long, the BJP has been of the opinion that until it uproots the Sena from the Mumbai corporation, it cannot reign over all of Maharashtra. A few months from now, the richest municipal corporation in the country will go to polls. The BJP sees this as an opportunity to end the Senaâs two-decade old hegemony over the Rs 42,000-crore municipal corporation. Mumbai is crucial to BJP but itâs more than a lifeline for the Sena. And the BJP is determined to cut it.

For, the Mumbai metropolitan region alone contributes as many as 60 MLAs to the 288-member state legislature and 11 MPs to Parliament out of the 48 from Maharashtra. The BJP, however, is equally aware that it canât win over Mumbai and the neighbouring region on its own and that it needs a partner who can help negate the Shiv Sena.

Enter the MNS. Interesting as this may seem, itâs not for the first time that the ruling party in the state has had a tacit understanding with a Thackeray-led political outfit. In the 1960s and 70s, it was the Congress-led Maharashtra government that looked the other way when Shiv Sena went on a rampage against non-Maharashtrians.

If it was Bal Thackeray who had clandestine support from successive state governments then, it is now Raj Thackeray who has an implicit understanding with the BJP-led state government. Bal Thackeray came in handy for Marathi Congress leaders like the late Vasantdada Patil, Vasantrao Naik etc to neutralise Congress factions led by the likes of late Rajni Patel, Murli Deora etc then. The BJP now views the Raj Thackeray-led MNS as a counterbalance to Shiv Sena.

There are two reasons for the BJPâs politics. First, at stake is the Mumbai municipal corporation, crucial to the BJPâs larger game plan with 2019 in mind. Maharashtra is destined to play an extremely important role should the BJP get a second chance at the Centre.

With 48 MPs, Maharashtra is the second biggest state after UP that has 80 seats and where BJP has already peaked with 72 MPs. Other big states such as Bihar and Tamil Nadu do not offer much hope to the BJP. It makes Maharashtra a key state for the ruling party. And in Maharashtra, itâs the Mumbai metropolitan region thatâs critical to the BJP gameplan. Incidentally, the entire region, that has large corporations like Mumbai and Thane, will have polls to elect new city rulers.

And the second reason is Mumbaiâs vantage position. Any accomplishment in Mumbai has had a multiplying effect all over the nation. Itâs no coincidence that Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Make In India campaign here in Mumbai, followed by the setting up of the first Kaushalya Vikas Kendra â skill development centre â again in Mumbai. Itâs also no coincidence that the megalopolis has been witnessing a slew of large infra projects that promise big-ticket investment. The ruling party is leaving no stone unturned to convert Mumbai into a jewel in its crown.

The only threat the BJP faces is from Shiv Sena. On the other hand, fully aware of BJPâs machinations, the Sena has been consistently raising its pitch against the BJP. No day passes without the Sena verbally attacking the BJP. Itâs just getting bitter and sharper in the run-up to the approaching elections.

In MNS, the BJP sees one which can successfully take away the political space of the Sena. Besides, in Raj, the BJP leadership see a more reliable and stable partner.

So the controversy over Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is just collateral damage in a renewed game of partner swap. Itâs just the beginning.",POLITICS

391,PLTE033SRC002,"A day after Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis brokered peace between Raj Thackeray and Karan Johar for the smooth release of the latters film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (ADHM), the ruling BJPs ally Shiv Sena, celebrities and activists panned the two for making an extortionist deal.
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who is camping in Panaji ahead of the assembly polls next year, slammed the deal as extortion, while Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that the BJP will ruin the country.
Criticising Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, Uddhav said, The Indian Army has its self respect. So, it does not need any money eked out of extortion. If you want to help, then do it from the heart. Whatever you want to do, do it straight from your heart. 
We dont have complete information on the talks at Varsha. But I have got one piece of information. The three of them together are now going to make a new movie, Yeh to hona hi tha (This was set to happen).
Uddhavs remarks come at a time of growing differences between allies Shiv Sena and BJP, and a question over the alliances future in the run-up to the 2017 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.
Actor and activist Shabana Azmi tweeted, What a sorry state of affairs. The chief minister brokers a deal and buys patriotism for Rs 5 crore after the union home minister had promised a peaceful passage for ADHM. The chief minister shows scant respect for the home ministers assurance of safe passage for ADHM. BJP better haul him up and demand explanation.
Author Shobhaa De branded the enforcement of a Rs 5-crore contribution to the Army Relief Fund in exchange for ADHMs peaceful release as a price tag on patriotism.
Has any political party donated even 5 paise? Leave the army alone. This sort of constant interference and attempts to manipulate can lead to disastrous consequences, she tweeted.
Fadnavis had on Saturday mediated talks between Raj Thackeray and director Karan Johar for the smooth release of ADHM, starring Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, at his residence Varsha in Mumbai. After the meeting, movie producers succumbed to the MNS demand of not casting any Pakistani actors in future and also agreed to give Rs 5 crore as penance to the army welfare fund.
Raj Thackeray-led MNS had earlier threatened to stall the Diwali release of the movie.
Meanwhile, CPI(M) accused Fadnavis of facilitating extortion. Describing the episode as a gross insult to the valour of armed forces, CPI(M) asked Centre to take serious note of Fadnavis alleged failure in upholding the rule of law by acting against MNS.",POLITICS

Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said the exhibition of films is guided not by the âgoonsâ of any organisation but by the Cinematographic Act that permits screening after clearance by the Censor Board. It was the duty, he said, of State governments to uphold the law and ensure that films that had the necessary official clearances could be screened, while maintaining law and order.

Instead, he said, Mr. Fadnavis presided over a meeting of the MNS and representatives of the film industry that decided that a sum of money would be deposited with the Army Welfare Fund in exchange for allowing the screening of any film that had Pakistani actors. Not surprisingly, he said, the Army itself had rejected this âblood money.â

This arbitration, the Congress spokesperson said, was enough to demand Mr. Fadnavisâs resignation.

âIt (8 per cent growth) is achievable and the government is working with this commitment.

As an example, she pointed towards the healthy competition amongst the states to have better ranking in several aspects, similar to the competitive spirit that India has to reach a top position in the global rankings.

An inter-ministerial work assessment will be undertaken to ensure all work moves fast and this goal is achieved, she stated.

The motive behind Rudresh's murder, the police said, was the fact that Rudresh was getting popular among the locals in Shivajinagar and the accused persons could not accept his popularity. The police, however, did not clear the air on whether this was a political killing or a contract killing.

A man with an unusual limp and a constable with a sharp memory were the crucial pointers that led to the police cracking the murder of Rudresh, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker in the city.

For the first three days after Rudresh was hacked by two unidentified men on a motorcycle on Kamaraj Road, while on his way back from an RSS programme on October 16, the police had very few clues to go by.

The CCTV footage in the area was too blurred to reveal the faces of the two attackers, and the motorcycle they used did not have registration plates.

âMoreover, we were stretched trying to preserve law and order in the area,â said Police Commissioner N.S. Megharikh to presspersons on Thursday.

In the days following the murder, thousands of people from the BJP, the RSS, and affiliated organisations held a rally in the area demanding the speedy arrest of the culprits.

Meanwhile, the CCTV footage was sent to forensic labs to sharpen the images. A week later, even as political pressure mounted, the police got a break.

On analysing the footage, the Commercial Street police observed two men, in the background, walking away suspiciously after the incident. While others looked shocked and some even ran towards Rudresh to help him, these two men casually exited the scene.

âThey became suspects, and one of the men was walking with a distinct limp. A constable from the Commercial Street Police Station said he recognised the limp,â said Mr. Megharikh.

The constable recalled that a man who walked with a similar gait worked as mechanic in a shop in the area. He identified him as Mohammad Majibullah.

Later that day, Majibullah was picked up for questioning and he revealed his associates, Irfan Pasha, Mohammad Mazar, and Wasim Ahmed.

They work as either mechanics or roadside vendors, and do not have previous cases filed against them.

However, there could be more persons behind the murder. A senior police official said the murder seemed to have been done with elaborate planning. âWe are on the lookout for others who may have been involved in the conspiracy,â said the official.",POLITICS

Bush, who lives in Houston, is expected to be discharged in the next couple of days. He was president from 1989 to 1993. He has had his share of health issues in recent years. In July 2015, he was taken to a hospital in Portland, Maine, after he fractured a bone in his neck in a fall at the familyâs summer home in Kennebunkport. He was âup and talking and out of bedâ within a day after the fall. The fall happened about six months after he was taken by ambulance to Houston Methodist for what his spokesman called âshortness of breath.â He was released from the hospital about a week later. In late 2012, Bush was admitted to the hospital for a bronchitis-related cough. He was later released but returned the day after Thanksgiving because of a persistent cough.

Reuters was not immediately able to reach the family spokesman Jim McGrath or the hospital where Bush was taken.
Bush is the father of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
The elder Bush, a Republican like his sons, served as vice president during Ronald Reagan's two White House terms before being elected president in 1988. He served four years in the White House.
Bush has used a wheelchair in his later years and was hospitalized twice in 2014 - once for seven weeks with pneumonia and again for breathing difficulties. In July 2015 he broke a bone in his neck in a fall at the family home in Maine.
Bush's public appearances have been rare since he entered his 90s. In October 2015, Bush, sitting his wheelchair, wearing a brace on his neck and clad in a Houston Astros jersey, tossed out the first pitch at the team's playoff game against the Kansas City Royals.

Becker did not immediately return email or telephone calls to her office from The Associated Press. 
Bush, who served as US president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalised in Maine in 2015 after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck, and was hospitalised in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. 
He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. 
Despite the loss of mobility, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration.

408,PLTE039SRC001," The council has been deadlocked in the last four meetings, the last one being on January 4, with states seeking sole powers to control assessee with annual turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore. (PTI) 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will tomorrow look to break the deadlock over distribution of powers between centre and states to administer GST, an issue that is holding up launch of the new national sales tax from April. The all-powerful GST Council, headed by Jaitley, will meet for the ninth time tomorrow with the issue of who gets to administer the Goods and Services Tax (GST) being the single biggest issue on agenda. 
The council has been deadlocked in the last four meetings, the last one being on January 4, with states seeking sole powers to control assessee with annual turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore. 
Centre, however, is not in favour of a horizontal split as it feels states do not have the expertise to administer levies like service tax. 
Jaitley is also not favour of dual agencies auditing and scrutinising each taxpayer as he reckons multiple authorities could end up acting at cross-purposes. 
Jaitley had last week hoped to resolve the pending issues to get the new indirect tax regime rolling from April 1. 
âMost of the issues have been sorted out, some critical issues remain and these critical issues over the next few weeks we will try and solve out,â he said last week. âWe would want it to be implemented from April if all issues are resolved.â 
The GST Council is also to discuss the taxation of trade in territorial waters. Also the corpus to be created for compensating states for loss of revenue from GST rollout may figure in tomorrowâs meeting, sources said. 
The council had in previous meeting agreed on most of the clauses of the draft IGST law, which along with Central-GST (CGST) and State-GST (SGST) have to be passed by the Parliament and state legislatives respectively before the new tax regime can be rolled out. 
Interated-GST or IGST deals with levy on inter-state supply (including stock transfers) of goods or services. 
GST will subsume a host of indirect taxes levied by the centre and the states, including excise duty, value-added tax, service tax, entry tax, luxury tax and entertainment tax. 
The Parliament passed the landmark constitutional amendment in August last year and more than half of state legislatures ratified it by mid-September. According to Jaitley, GST needs to be rolled out latest by September 16, 2017. 
Under the Constitutional Amendment passed by Parliament for the GST implementation, some of the existing levies would expire after September 16. 
GST would transform India into a single market, boost revenues through better compliance and simpler procedure. ",POLITICS

The ruling PDP-BJP government will not table the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in the current Budget session of the Legislature and may call a special session, on the pattern of other states of the country, to the pass the legislation before its effective implementation. The state government has set up a high-powered committee to formulate its own law and submit it to the Legislature to ensure that its special powers remain intact. âThe Budget session will conclude by the first week of February. It may not be possible for the government to introduce the Bill in the Budget session of the Legislature as the high-powered committee is yet to draft the legislation,â said the state governmentâs Economic Survey report which was tabled in both Houses in the current session. The report said the government may call a special session as was being done by some state governments to pass the GST Bill. âThe GST will replace all indirect taxes levied on goods and services by the Central and state governments. The GST in the state may miss the previous deadline of April 1, 2017, set by the Central government for its implementation across the country as the GST Council, which met in the Union capital a few days back had failed to reach a consensus on the issue of dual control. It was expected to meet again next week in New Delhi to work out a consensus,â the report suggested. In his Budget speech on January 11, Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu had said the proposed GST law was not applicable to J&K. âWe will have to work out in what form it can be applied given the fact that under our General Sales Tax Act, 1962, we tax services unlike other states,â he had said. The GST Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on August 3, 2016, and the amendment Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on August 6 last year. The assent from the President was received on September 8, 2016, and stood notified in a government gazette. At least 23 states have already ratified the Bill while eight states are yet to ratify it. These eight states are J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, UP, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has asked all states, including Jammu and Kashmir, which havenât passed the legislation so far, to approve it at the earliest to clear the decks for implementation of one tax structure across the country. âThe J&K Government has decided to implement the GST in the state and set up a high-level committee to be headed by the Financial Commissioner, Planning, Development and Monitoring Department, for drafting the legislation, which would be tabled before the government, and after clearance, in the Legislature. The panel has been asked to draft the legislation within next three months,â the report said. The state government has deliberated upon the issue and came to the conclusion that it should implement the GST but with riders so that its constitutional position and special taxation powers are not affected.",POLITICS
410,PLTE039SRC003," In the pursuit of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) introduction from 1 April 2017, it was anticipated that the model GST law will be taken up for approval during the winter session of the parliament. However, with complete washout of winter session of parliament due to demonetisation issue coupled with lack of consensus in GST Council on many contentious issues, it is now highly unlikely that the said target date will be met despite sincere efforts by the Honâble Finance Minister. The GST Council has met several times in last few months, however, decision on vexed issues such as sharing of administrative powers between the centre and the state governments, higher compensation and the definition of territory of coastal states are still remaining inconclusive. Though 1 April 2017 looks difficult, the Finance Minister has recently clarified that GST being a transaction tax, the same can be implemented from any date and not only from the beginning of the financial year. Also, it was stated that due to constitutional compulsion GST must be implemented by September 2017, else the right to levy the existing taxes will lapse. Now, the focus has shifted to the Budget session commencing from 31 January 2017 where the GST model laws are likely to be placed for approval of both the Houses of Parliament. To meet these timelines, GST Council will need to thrash out the issues and agree on the final GST law in their meeting scheduled on 16 January 2017 followed by passage of the law both by centre and respective state governments. Union Budget 2017-18 is expected to be unique in many aspects, one, this will be the first Budget immediately after demonetization and second it will be announced on 1 February instead of customary date of February 28. With uncertainty looming large on date of introduction of GST, the Finance Ministry has its task cut out in terms of estimating or one may say guesstimating the indirect tax revenue for the fiscal year 2017-18. Will the trend of 25 percent increase in the indirect tax collection during April-December 2016 play a role in such revenue estimate is anybodyâs call. With GSTâs implementation date within sight (latest by September 2017), the government is expected to release the much awaited road map for implementation with clear timelines and activities including readiness of GST Network (GSTN). Besides the clearly defined road map for GST roll out, the government may take steps to bridge the gap between the current tax rates vis-Ã -vis the probable rate in GST so that the negative effect of inflation on introduction of GST can be managed. The inverted duty structure is likely to be further rationalized. The government may also propose the transitional provisions in the existing indirect tax laws which will apply upon introduction of GST. Though no big bang reforms in the customs and excise are expected in the wake of GST reform, however, one can look forward to some changes in the customs/excise duty rates to support make in India initiative. The service tax rate may get aligned to proposed standard rate under GST draft law. Further, to provide support to the exporters, government may announce certain beneficial scheme including clarifying the treatment of export schemes in GST regime. The Industry is eagerly awaiting the early release of the draft GST Rules and procedure so that they can initiate changes in their IT system for being GST ready. Overall, projection of indirect tax revenue in an uncertain environment will be like shooting in the dark and one can look forward to innovative ways of the government to ensure that the budget is a near accurate estimate rather than being purely a guesstimate.

Immediately after Islamabad released Indian soldier Babulal Chavan, Pakistan high commissioner to India Abdul Basit had told TOI that Pakistan expected India to acknowledge the repatriation and release 33 Pakistanis whose sentences had run out. ""We have identified the prisoners and with Pakistan confirming their nationality, they will be released on March 1,"" said an official source. While India has reacted cautiously to the house arrest of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed, the Centre believes it may be the right time to open channels of communication. The move comes even though a full-fledged diplomatic dialogue remains no more than a barely visibile speck on the horizon. India has repeatedly said in the past couple of months that it won't dilute its stand that there can be no dialogue without demonstrable action from Pakistan against terror groups targeting India. However, there's also a feeling within the government that India needs to reciprocate to the opening which Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif , according to diplomats there, has sought to provide after the retirement of Raheel Sharif as army chief. This saw the government inviting Pakistan for a South Asia Speakers' Summit in Indore last week and also seeking to promote people-to-people contact by ensuring and sponsoring Indian participation in the Karachi Literature Festival. Officially though, it continued to insist these developments shouldn't be seen as a precursor to resumption of talks. The release of prisoners and fishermen will be more significant though as that's exactly what Pakistan was looking for to take the peace process forward. In fact, in his first reach out to India after he saw the back of Raheel, Sharif too had released over 200 Indian fishermen on his birthday on December 25 last year. He followed it up with the release of Chavan, who was said to have ""inadvertently"" crossed over into Pakistan territory.

Thousands of students on Wednesday gathered on the sands of Marina beach in Chennai as protests demanding lifting of the ban on bull-taming sport jallikattu snowballed across Tamil Nadu.
Faced with mounting anger on the streets, the top brass of the state government got into a huddle as Chief Minister O Panneerselvam decided to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday seeking an ordinance for conduct of the age-old sport. He will be accompanied by 51 MPs of AIADMK.
The CM appealed to students to give up their protests even as IT sector employees and several more actors joined the chorus for allowing jallikattu.
The epicentre of protests appeared to have shifted to the state capital with thousands of students and youths collecting on Marina beach demanding an end to the ban on the age-old sport, saying it symbolised Tamil culture and the ban reflected an anti-Tamil mindset.
Symbolic 'jallikattu' events, where bulls were let loose, were reported from Madurai, Sivaganga and Pattukottai.
Crowds, meanwhile, continued to swell at Alanganallur and Tamukkam grounds in Madurai, the traditional base for the sport.
Protesters at Alanganallur demanded that the Centre issue an ordinance to allow Jallikattu before 6 PM on Wednesday.
Animal rights organisation PeTA, which had moved the Supreme Court against holding of the sport, was the target of attack by protesters who demanded that it should be wound up.
The agitation by students, voluntary groups of pro-Tamil outfits and farmers was well-attended with thousands thronging the venue including here and Madurai.
Tension prevailed at Tamukkam grounds as three students attempted to set themselves ablaze which was foiled by police.
Employees working in the Information Technology sector today joined the agitation here by forming human chains and staging protests in the vicinity of their workplaces including the city's IT corridor on Rajiv Gandhi Salai.
Seven activists of a pro-Tamil outfit climbed the historic Pamban railway bridge in Rameswaram and held a dharna. When they were removed by police, they threatened to jump into the sea and commit suicide if they were arrested.
Tension prevailed in Kandipatti village in Sivaganga where 'Manju Virattu' (bull chasing) was organised with 100 bulls. Police baton-charged to disperse the participants.
However, the protesters allegedly attacked police with stones damaging a police vehicle and reinforcements were sent to bring the situation under control.
At Pasukaranpatti in Madurai district, organisers released many bulls with prize money attached to their horns on the road leaving it to youths to tame them and take the prize money. Similar events were held near Pattukottai in which 30 bulls participated. 
In view of the intensifying protests, the Chief Minister held a high-level meeting with top officials including Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan, DGP T K Rajendran and Chennai Police Commissioner S George.
More film personalities, including actors Vishal, comedian Vivek and Sivakarthikeyan on Wednesday expressed support for 'jallikattu'. Actors' body South Indian Artistes' Association announced a hunger strike on January 20 on the issue.
Talks by State Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar and School Education Minister K Pandiarajan followed by senior police officials failed to dissuade the protestors on Marina beach here who insisted that the Chief Minister visit the site and give an assurance that the sport would be allowed.
Protests were held and rallies taken out in several districts including Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Madurai, Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Theni, Thanjavur, Salem, Erode, Karur, Dharmapuri and Kanyakumari.
Also, 'road rokos' were held in various locations, including Ramanathapuram.
In rallies and protests by students and IT employees, slogans like 'We want jallikattu' and 'Ban anti-Tamil PETA' were raised.
In Virudachalam in Cuddalore district where students resorted to 'rail roko', chaotic scenes were witnessed with police removing them from the spot.
Two youths resorted to a flash protest by climbing a mobile phone tower in Namakkal and lawyers took out a rally in Dindigul and led decorated bulls in a procession.
The protests by students were nearly complete with those studying in Annamalai and Azhagappa universities in Chidambaram and Karaikudi respectively joining it.
Farmers Joint Action Council President Deivasigamani told reporters in Thanjavur that the Centre should announce its decision on 'jallikattu' within 48 hours, else they would organise state-wide agitation on January 20.
In Madurai and surrounding regions, more than 20 traders organisations also announced closure of shops on January 20 if the ban on 'jallikattu' was not lifted.
Actor Vishal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking an ordinance facilitating conduct of jallikattu.
Actor Sivakarthikeyan tweeted, ""We need jallikattu."" AIADMK organisational secretary C Ponnaiyan blamed the Centre on the matter.
""The Centre is inordinately delaying or avoiding issuance of an ordinance (to allow holding of 'jallikattu') which is well within their hands,"" he told PTI, adding more measures were being taken on the issue to facilitate holding the bull-taming sport.

As protests demanding lifting of ban on jallikattu rocked Tamil Nadu today, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said he will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to seek an ordinance allowing the bull-taming sport. 
Panneerselvam has also requested the protesters - thousands gathered at Chennai's Marina Beach alone - to give up their demonstration. 
The Supreme Court had on January 12 rejected a plea urging it to pass judgement on the sport before the Pongal festival. 
The apex court had outlawed Jallikattu in 2014 and the state government's review petition was also dismissed last December. It has also reserved judgement on a matter related to the Centre's notification of last year to exempt Jallikattu from the ban. 
The Madras High Court today said it will not ""interfere"" on the issue of protests in Chennai against the ban on Jallikattu, holding that the Supreme Court was seized of the matter. 
Meanwhile, a massive state-wide protest, being held demanding holding of jallikattu and banning the animal rights group PETA, entered second day today. 
The demonstration began on Tuesday morning after the news of the arrest of jallikattu protesters in Alanganallur town of Madurai district spread. 
A number of Tamil Nadu politicians, actors and celebrities have come out in support of the bull-taming sport.

With the pro-jallikattu (bull-taming sport) protests turning into a mass movement in Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam held talks with representatives of the protesters in Chennai and flew to New Delhi on Wednesday night to take up the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Separately, AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala backed the demand to ban the global NGO, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), originally raised by DMK leader M.K. Stalin two days ago. 
âIt is our rightâ 
However, the representatives refused to call off their agitation, which spawned overnight at the Marina in Chennai, Alanganallur in Madurai, VOC Grounds in Coimbatore and other districts, saying they would await the outcome of the scheduled talks between Mr. Modi and Mr. Panneerselvam on Thursday morning. 
Backing the demand of the protesters, the Chief Minister told journalists outside the Chennai airport, âJallikattu is our right. I am going to insist to the Centre to intervene and promulgate an ordinance to facilitate its conduct.â Initiated on social media platforms, the demonstrations, which were initially confined to college students and rural folk, overnight snowballed into a mass movement of sorts. 
At many cities and towns, top revenue and police officials tried in vain to negotiate with the protesters. The Tamil Nadu Government Employeesâ Association decided to stage demonstrations on Thursday to express solidarity with the cause. 
Sensing the popular mood, the film fraternity also joined the chorus for jallikattu. Already leading actors like Vijay, Suriya, Vikram, Dhanush, Nayantara and many others extended support to the sport claiming that it was the symbol of Tamil culture. Nadigar Sangam has announced a day-long hunger strike on Friday. Sangam secretary actor Vishal wrote a letter to the Prime Minister seeking an ordinance. 
The social media became a rallying point for animal rights activists who stood by the ban and picked holes in the popular discourse in support of jallikattu. 
Dalit voices countered the demand for jallikattu by stating that the bull taming sport has strong caste overtones and not a traditional sport. 
In view of the massive student protests, many State universities declared holiday on Thursday. In Chennai, several colleges announced that they will remain closed on Thursday.

The Haryana Assembly will take up for discussion the ongoing Jat reservation stir tomorrow after opposition Congress and INLD moved an adjournment motion in this regard. Speaker Kanwar Pal stated that all things barring the part which is sub-judice will be discussed in the House. During Zero Hour, Leader of Opposition and senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala sought to know the governmentâs reply on the ongoing stir by the Jats which has been going on for a month now. 
Referring to last yearâs stir in which 30 persons were killed, Chautala said that the government had promised to accept the demands of those agitating which included giving Rs 10 lakh and government jobs to the next of kin of those who died in the agitation in February 2016, withdrawal of cases slapped last year and release of those jailed after the stir turned violent. 
Chautala alleged that the state BJP government had gone back on its promises made to the Jats and they had been forced to sit on protest in June and now February this year. 
âAgain, this year, they have been forced to sit on protest and the dharnas have been going on for a month now. It is not only the Jats who are sitting on the dharnas, but they are being supported from all sections of the society,â he said. 
The Speaker told him that since the Jat reservation issue was sub-judice, he will look into what part of the adjournment motion that has been moved can be admitted and discussed in the House. 
At this, former chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda got up and said that only the reservation part was sub-judice and there was no bar to discuss the rest of the things pertaining to the stir. 
âThousands of people are sitting on the dharnas across the state for a month now. Reservation is not their only demand, there are so many issues that are involved and should be discussed here in the House,â Hooda said. 
Hooda also targeted the government, alleging that development has come to a standstill. 
âMinisters and officers of the Khattar government cannot go and move in villages because of public angerâ¦again they (are Jats) have been forced to agitate. The government must resolve this issue,â Hooda said. 
Afterwards, the Speaker adjourned the House for half an hour and held a meeting with the opposition leaders from the Congress and INLD. 
After the House re-assembled, the Speaker informed that it has been decided that the issue will be taken up tomorrow. 
Besides seeking quota in education and government jobs under Other Backward Classes category, the demands of the Jats include release of those jailed during last yearâs agitation, withdrawal of cases slapped during the protest and government jobs for the kin of those killed or injured while taking part in the stir. 
Later, interacting with reporters outside the Assembly, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar when asked to comment on the adjournment motion moved by the INLD and Congress, said âthe Speaker has clarified by saying that part (Jat issue) which is sub-judice, there will no discussion, rest will be discussed at lengthâ. 
Replying to a question, Khattar said âWe have always been open for any talks. Now, they (Jats) have put forward 18-point charter of demands. We are ready to talk and do whatever is possible within the ambit of the Constitution.â 
Talking to reporters outside the Assembly complex, Abhay Chautala said they moved adjournment motion to seek a reply from the government. 
âWe had said earlier that we will raise the matter in the House and seek a concrete reply from the government on the issue,â Chautala said. 
Chautala said that Speaker had to adjourn the House on this issue today âand it has been decided that the issue will be discussed tomorrowâ. 
Attacking the Congress, the INLD leader said, âIt is strange that Congress too is moving an adjournment motion on this issue. They should, in fact, apologise to all those who are agitating because all of what is happening today is because of their (Congressâ) mistakes who brought half-baked reservation during their time. Had they done their homework properly, situation which we are currently witnessing would not have been the caseâ.

The Jat agitation seeking reservation in education and government jobs will continue across the State. All-India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti president Yashpal Malik said, âWe had a second round of talks with the government officials on Monday in Panipat but they remained inconclusive. The government has formed a four member committee to look into the cases filed against the youth in last yearâs agitation and whether they can be withdrawn as per law or not. The committee will have two government officials and two of our representatives. But we are stuck to our demand that these cases should be withdrawn.â In the first round of talks held on February 12 between Jat leaders and the committee, the leaders had given a charter of seven demands and the committee had reportedly promised to look into them. âWe have given the government five days time to resolve all our demands and get back to us.

He claimed that the government has agreed to enhance the compensation of those injured with bullet injuries from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh. Praising Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Yashpal Malik said that Khattar is a good person but some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are eyeing his post and thus misleading the government. They have already decided to hold a protest on March 2 in Delhi after which they will submit a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking reservation in education and government jobs, and will on a later date gherao Parliament. The charter of demands to the State government include a demand that the cases registered against the protesting youth be immediately withdrawn, reservation be given to the Jat community both in educational institutions and jobs or that the Union government reservation be extended. They also demanded compensation and jobs to those injured in last year's protests, permanent jobs to the kin of the deceased protest victims and that action should be taken against officials who instigated violence in the protests. They also demanded an inquiry to be conducted by Parliament Ethics Committee against Member of Parliament Raj Kumar Saini for his provocative speeches against the Jat community in the last two years, and action be taken against him accordingly.

They should come forward for talks unconditionally. The government's door are always open and it has never refused dialogue with the agitators,"" Khattar told the media here.

Finance Minister Abhimanyu also said the state's Bharatiya Janata Party government is ready for talks with an ""open mind"" on job reservation for the Jat community within constitutional limits.
""Leaders of opposition political parties are trying to mislead the youths to regain lost political ground through protests.

But before March 20, he would get them in-touch with a Central Minister. He said that all issues concerning Jat reservation would be re-investigated. Apart from this, the Government has no problem in re-investigating the cases of the year 2010 to 2015. The cases that are lying in the court would be decided by the court, CM said. The next of kin of those who have lost their lives in the agitation and those who got disabilities or their next of kin would be given permanent employment within 60 days. The march to Delhi fixed for March 20 will remain suspended, the CM said, adding that it was also mentioned that after the press conference, all the 'Dharnas' except 10 'Dharnas', would be withdrawn.

The advocate was appointed with the consent of Jat leaders to plead the case in the court. The compensation to the victims has already been given. The offer of job was also made by the government and compensation to the injured was being delivered. ""The cases which were pending in the court were not a part of government's decision. The government can only ask the court to re-examine some cases relating to the innocents,"" he said. Jats have been sitting on dharna in various parts of Haryana since January 29. Besides seeking quota, the demands of the Jats include release of those jailed during last year's agitation, withdrawal of cases slapped during the protest and government jobs for the kin of those killed and injured while taking part in the stir.

""I was on the second floor campaigning for hostel committee elections. After hearing the commotion I ran down. (ABVP) said he was assaulted by Najeeb. I went up to Najeeb who was bleeding from his head. I asked him but he wasn't able to speak. He went to the washroom,"" he said

""Another student Ankit said he wanted to use the washroom. I stopped him fearing he will again beat Najeeb. Ankit said he won't and once inside started assaulting him. After we got him (Najeeb) out and were taking him to the warden's office downstairs a group of 15-20 students literally lynched him,"" Shahid alleged.

Shahid claimed that the proctor is making statements based on what is saying and is refusing to state the depositions of the 20-odd neutral students.

""15 of us deposed before the police as well. But the police is yet to act against the assaulters,"" added Shahid.

443,PLTE050SRC002,"JNU issued a 25-point bulletin on Wednesday in connection with the case of student Najeeb Ahmed, who has been missing for the last 12 days from the campus.

However, the varsityâs teachers association fumed over the administration selectively omitting the fact that he was attacked during a brawl a night before.

The university has point-wise listed the sequence of events beginning from the brawl. According to the bulletin, the hostel warden had submitted a report of the student brawl stating âNajeeb had slapped Vikrant of the ABVP without any provocation and the issue was resolved by the warden with some disciplinary measures as Najeeb had admitted his mistake of initiating the brawlâ.

Jnuta took strong exception to the bulletin issued by the university and issued a statement saying that the summary does not even mention beating of Najeeb by a group of students, a fact which has not only been in public domain but also mentioned by the warden in his statement who was an eyewitness.

âSuch omission appears to be deliberate and could put serious questions on objectivity of the enquiry process. We are deeply worried if there is any attempt to give clean-chit in advance to those who are out there to bring mob violence in JNU. Acts of intended omission and commission will not bring any good to university and slowly all sections will lose faith in administrationâ it added.

Meanwhile, around hundred of students tried to block the Nelson Mandela Marg Wednesday evening to protest against non-highlighting of the fact that Najeeb was also beaten up.

âIt is a festival time and the stretch witnesses increased vehicular traffic in the evening. We tried to explain the students, but they refused to listen following which we had to detain around 40 of them while the rest escaped,â a senior police official said.

The update that drew charges of bias and insensitivity - the whereabouts of Najeeb are not known for more than 10 days - came on a day several students claimed that they were assaulted in Vasant Vihar police station after being detained during a protest. The JNU update makes no mention of the alleged assault on Najeeb by ABVP supporters on the intervening night of October 14 and 15. A warden's committee report dated October 16 says witnesses claimed that a ""brutal assault"" was committed on Najeeb by a group of students. Najeeb, a biotechnology freshman, has been missing since the morning of October 15. A police special investigation team is looking for him and a proctorial inquiry on the violence in JNU is yet to conclude. Students and teachers have been protesting against an earlier media release by the administration, which had described Najeeb as an ""accused"" in a ""complaint of physical violence"" in Mahi Mandovi Hostel. The official release today said: ""Najeeb slapped Vikrant Kumar without any provocation in front of Ankit Kumar (214-Mahi) and Sunil Pratap (122-Mahi)."" Vikrant, Ankit and Sunil were campaigning for a hostel election. In a complaint file by several hostel residents to chief proctor A.P. Dimri, all three have been accused of assaulting Ahmed and making provocative statements. The JNU Teachers' Association issued a statement condemning today's release. ""The JNUTA takes strong exception to the statement issued by the administration.... The summary and update of the events at Mahi-Mandovi Hostel does not even mention the beating up of Najeeb by a group of students, a fact which has not only been in the public domain but is also categorically mentioned in the statement by the warden who was an eyewitness. Such omission appears to be deliberate and could put serious questions on the objectivity of the inquiry process,"" they said. In the evening, a group of more than 100 students attempted to block Nelson Mandela Road, opposite Vasant Vihar police station to protest alleged police inaction in finding Najeeb and demand prosecution of those accused of assaulting him. After asking the students to move, the police announced the gathering as unlawful and dragged the protesters into a bus. Before that, six students, including Aparajitha Raja of the CPI-backed All India Students Federation, former JNUSU vice president Anubhuti Bara, United Other Backward Classes Forum activist Birendra Kumar, were detained as they formed a human chain to block traffic. ""We were taken to a room, where we asked the officers whether we have been arrested. We asked for us to be allowed to peacefully protest. An officer said we shouldn't talk disrespectfully to police. An argument happened and then a policeman in riot gear began to hit Birendra. Anubhuti and I tried to save him. Then all the policemen and three women constables in plainclothes began to kick us and hit us with their elbows. Anubhuti and I were groped by policemen during the scuffle,"" said Aparajitha, daughter of CPI leader D. Raja. The students were taken to South Campus police station and later dropped back at JNU where they submitted a complaint. Additional DCP Nupur Prasad said: ""No one was hit. They were only restrained from blocking traffic at peak hour. It is impossible to assault anyone like that in a police station which is a public place."" Former JNUSU vice-president Shehla Rashid, who went inside Vasant Vihar police station, later said: ""Their hair was ruffled and some of them had swollen faces, some had small bruises. The policemen refused to register a complaint of custodial assault inside the police station.

According to government sources, from mid-August when it was started, till last week, the Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties had received donations worth around Rs 1.4 crore.The fund was started on the initiative of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who said a large number of organisations and individuals had approached him with the desire to aid families of soldiers who had died in battle. In a statement, the Defence Ministry had said that it had received a surge of such requests after the Siachen avalanche in February, which had led to the death of 10 soldiers.

The Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties was started as a centralised fund, to accept donations and contributions from organisations and individuals, and to be managed by the adjutant general branch of the Army.

The assistance from the fund is meant to be in addition to the existing schemes for relatives of soldiers who die in battle. An SOP in this regard was approved by the Defence Ministry last month.

The ministrys statement had said contribution to the fund must be voluntary in nature, to be used exclusively for Next of Kins of Battle Casualties. The ministry is considering a proposal to make contributions to the fund eligible for tax exemption.

Army sources Sunday refused to be drawn into the controversy, while calling the question of rejecting or accepting Rs 5 crore from Mumbai filmmakers working with Pakistani artistes as hypothetical.

The figure was arrived at a meeting on Saturday, with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis  mediating between Ae Dil Hai Mushkil director Karan Johar and MNS chief Raj Thackeray, who had threatened to block its release.",POLITICS

Film & Television Producers Guild of India president Mukesh Bhatt, producers Sidharth Roy Kapur, Sajid Nadiadwala and Vijay Singh of Fox Star Studios were also present in the meeting.
""Every producer who has cast a Pakistani actor must contribute Rs 5 crore to the Army welfare fund,"" MNS chief Raj Thackeray said after the meeting.
The MNS chief also raised a question over casting Pakistani actors+ in Indian films. ""While Pakistan has banned Indian content, why do we give them a red carpet here,"" Raj Thackeray asked.
Thackeray said that ""producers will have to give in writing that they will not take Pakistani actors in their films in future.""
Claiming victory for MNS agitation, Raj Thackeray said: ""We have always protested against Pakistani artistes but Bollywood never understood earlier. Now they have realised.""
Earlier, speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mukesh Bhatt said that it was ""positive and constructive and 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will release as per the schedule.""
""We discussed the unfortunate events related to the film's release. I shared the film industry's emotions regarding the entire issue. We are Indians first and then comes our business,"" he said.

Heading a Congress-led coalition government, Kamat, along with then state PWD Minister Churchill Alemao and other government officials have been accused of allegedly accepting a $976,630 bribe in 2010 from officials of US-based consultancy firm.

While Alemao has already been arrested last year and charge-sheeted subsequently before a special court, Kamat has managed to evade arrest. However his anticipatory bail has been challenged by the Crime Branch in the apex court.

 The accused are charged under section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC, and under sections 7,8 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 



 On July 21, 2015, the Crime Branch had registered an FIR against unknown ministers of then government of 2010. 



 The alleged bribery had come to light after Louis Berger company admitted to the violations under US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and agreed to pay penalty of USD 17.1 million to resolve the charge that it had bribed foreign officials. 



 The Rs 1,031-crore project, funded by JICA, was approved when the Digamber Kamat government was in power for augmenting water supply in south and laying sewerage lines in the state's major cities. 



 Louis Berger was part of a consultancy consortium appointed by two Japanese firms and an Indian partner for managing USD 311 million Water Supply and Sewerage Project awarded in 2009. 



 Crime branch had interrogated Kamat many times during the probe. He had secured anticipatory bail from local on August 19, 2015.

Now, the matter is in court. I've full faith in god and the judiciary,"" Kamat told TOI.Thursdayâs chargesheet, which comes a year after the first chargesheet was filed, also accused Kamat of appointing his close family members, including Yogiraj Digambar Kamat as proxy, in seven companies formed to dump accumulated wealth (bribe money).The chargesheet states that Kamat has accumulated immense wealth, running into crores of rupees, which he has deposited in bank accounts all over the country in his name as well as that of his proxy.On the completion of scrutiny of all property and bank account documents, a corroborative evidence will be submitted before the court.The crime branch has accused Kamat as prime conspirator, and Alemao and Goa project director of JICA-funded projects Anand Wachasunder as co-accused, in concealing file notings on JICA-funded projects in the state.The trio allegedly concealed the main noting in the file as it would have exposed their misdeeds.The earlier chargesheet, filed in September 2015, includes the names of Alemao, Wachansudar, former vice president of Louis Berger, India, Satyakam Mohanty, alleged hawala operator Raichand Soni and others under Prevention of Corruption Act, criminal conspiracy and for giving false information .The additional chargesheet also stated that Wachasunder has accumulated immense wealth, running into crores of rupees, also deposited in names of his close family members, who acted as proxy.

460,PLTE056SRC001,"The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016 could lead to famine in West Bengal as well as many other states, claimed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. 
Speaking to reporters after her quarterly review of the stateâs performance with ministers and departmental secretaries Mamata said that this ill-thought-out decision could lead to famine and severe problems for the informal sector that employs over 60 per cent of the working population. âThe decision to demonetise the currency has led to severe hardship among the poor and the marginalised. In many areas, labour is not available to harvest the grains from the field. In other parts of the state, farmers are not able to earn money from cultivation of vegetables as demand has slowed down and people are cutting consumption,â the chief minister said.
Mamata also harped on the effects of the currency ban on small traders, especially those who serve the marginal sections of society. âTea sellers who used to earn Rs500 a day are now unable to find customers due to shortage of currency. This Rs2,000-note has created more confusion and hardships for the people. This happens when the leadership loses connection with people,â said Mamata. Advertisement The BJP though has blamed Mamata Banerjee for trying to mislead people on the whole issue. âThe coffers of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) have been affected by demonetisation and that is why she is so angry. Also, the scams have proved how corrupt the party is,â said Dilip Ghosh, president of the West Bengal unit of the BJP.
TMC hit back that the upcoming polls would teach the party a lesson. âPolls are a great leveller. The BJP is still unsure of its strategy and the continuous change of rule has hurt the faith of the country in the currency and the Reserve Bank of India,â said senior TMC leader Saugata Roy. 
The economist said that the sudden announcement has hurt the low income group more than the so-called money hoarders. âThe decision will lead to a recession-like situation in the country and poor people will be the most affected,â said Ranjan Dasgupta, an economist. 
âCurrency is nothing else but a promise to pay. If people lose faith in it and its custodian, the central bank, then it is doomsday for the country. The continuous change in rules has eroded the faith of the people and also the fact that 97 per cent of the currency in circulation has come back means that the process has completely failed,â Dasgupta added.

Sitharaman said she has flagged various issues with the Chinese side about areas like IT and pharmaceuticals.

âIf exports to China should happen, it should happen directly from India to China. There are several Indian IT companies who have established business in China but whose operations are lagging behind schedule because permissions are not given easily and inspections are happening over and over again,â she said after launching a dashboard on foreign trade data.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (DMK) working chief MK Stalin and other party members , including the party's MLAs, are staging a hunger strike across Tamil Nadu to protest against the trust vote that took place in the state Assembly on February 18, which Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami won 122-11. 
 
The trust vote, however, did not take place peacefully. Stalin conducted a sit-in protest that led to further chaos in the Assembly's Well and subsequently he and his party's MLAs were thrown out of the House. Stalin later showed the media his torn shirt while coming out of the Assembly. He was also arrested later and an FIR was lodged against him for violation of public order. 
According to observers, Stalin is trying to send across the message through his hunger strike that he stands in the interest of the people. The tug-of-power for power between O Panneerselvam and Sasikala Natarajan in the AIADMK camp had led to condemnation from across the state and as neither of them got the prize they were aiming for, the DMK leadership is all the more eager to capitalise on the ruling party's inner turmoil. 
With both of the long-time faces of the state's politics now behind (Jayalalithaa is dead while one doesn't expect the nonagenarian M Karunanidhi to make a big return), it is logical for the next prominent face, i.e., Stalin, to believe that he deserves a chance more than either Palaniswami, Sasikala or Panneerselvam to become the state's chief minister. 
Stalin himself began his fast along with senior leader KN Nehru at 9 am on Wednesday at Uzhavar Sandhai grounds in Trichy. 
However, Stalin is also cautious that his image is not projected as one of a disruptor and as the future leader of the DMK who the state's people can trust whiel takes on the Opposition. If elections are to held anytime soon in Tamil Nadu, he would want to position himself as a worthy chief ministerial candidate who can guide his party to victory against the AIADMK. 
In the 2016 elections, the AIADMK had won 134 seats while the DMK got 89. The difference is not big and given the current ruckus in the AIADMK, the DMK would give itself an outside chance in case there are snap polls now. ",POLITICS
470,PLTE059SRC002," Two days after Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced a slew of welfare measures, DMK working president MK Stalin on Wednesday said the state government would not be able to implement them in view of its mounting debts. 
""They (Palaniswami regime) will not be able to involve themselves in efforts to implement the schemes,"" he said. 
He wondered how the government would be able to deliver on such promises ""when Tamil Nadu is reeling under a huge debt of Rs five lakh crore"". 
The DMK leader said Palaniswami's announcements were like that of his predecessors Panneerselvam and Jayalalithaa. 
On February 20, two days after he took over, Palaniswami had announced several welfare measures, including grant of subsidy to one lakh working women every year for purchase of mopeds or scooters and closure of 500 more state-run TASMAC liquor outlets, taking the total number of such shops shut since last year to 1,000. 
""Tamil Nadu has Rs five lakh crore debt... Now they say that they are going to give Scooty (50 per cent subsidy for women to buy scooters) I don't know how they will be able to give,"" Stalin said. 
Referring to closure of 500 IMFL shops in 2016 after Jayalalithaa had assumed office, the DMK leader sought to know if government was ready to release a 'white paper' on the liquor outlets closed by the late Chief Minister. 
He was winding up a day-long hunger strike by DMK here as part of state-wide protests over ""murder of democracy"" in the Assembly on February 18 when Chief Minister Palaniswami won a trust vote after eviction of DMK members. 
The Leader of the Opposition said the stir was held with the single objective of ousting the 'proxy regime,' in an apparent reference to jailed AIADMK chief VK Sasikala, who had propped up Palaniswami as the CM nominee after her conviction by the Supreme Court in a graft case. 
""Get ready to remove the proxy, atrocious regime. Let us prepare ourselves for it,"" Stalin, who led the DMK protest here, said. IUML leader K M Kader Mohideen was among those who participated in the fast. 
Citing suspicions from some quarters over Jayalalithaa's death, Stalin said that the first announcement ""after DMK comes to power"" would be an order for a judicial inquiry into her death. ""No one has locus standi to stop the inquiry,"" he said. 
He pointed out that when Palaniswami took over as Chief Minister, his party chief Sasikala was in jail. 
""If the state moves on under such circumstances, who will save Tamil Nadu and its people? Will this hunger strike be enough?... No,"" he said.

Mr Stalin is leading the hunger strike in Tiruchirapalli, around 350 kilometres from Chennai. Other leaders are protesting in various districts. The DMK and other opposition parties on February 18 demanded either a secret ballot, or the adjournment of the assembly session by a week after Chief Minister Palaniswami moved the confidence motion. Speaker P Dhanapal had refused to accept the demand made by opposition parties. DMK leaders then sat in protest inside the assembly and were later evicted by marshals.Chief Minister Palaniswami then went on to win the floor test after five hours of drama. Close to 100 opposition lawmakers were missing after there was violence and chaos over the demand for secret voting being declined. The DMK on Tuesday gave a letter intimating the party's decision to bring a no confidence motion against Mr Dhanapal.Mr Palaniswami proved his majority in the assembly with 122 votes in his favour. The 11 votes against him came from the rival O Panneerselvam camp that calls itself the real AIADMK.The voting had taken place after 88 DMK members were evicted and the Congress' eight walked out in protest. There were multiple adjournments of the state assembly amid chaos as DMK legislators broke chairs and a table, yanked out mics and surrounded and heckled the Speaker, P Dhanapal.The Speaker also alleged that he was ""tortured"" by opposition legislators, who tore his shirt. When marshals had tried to escort Mr Dhanapal out, DMK members pulled him back to his chair. One DMK legislator even sat on the Speaker's chair in protest.Mr Stalin had emerged from the assembly with his shirt torn and said that marshals had caused injuries while evicting him. He also alleged that his party's legislators were assaulted by the marshals. He later protested along with hundreds of DMK workers at the Marina Beach.E Palaniswami, who became Chief Minister because Ms Sasikala couldn't after being convicted for corruption, said with his government winning the confidence vote in the Tamil Nadu assembly, a vow taken the party chief had been fulfilled. He then visited the memorials of party founder MG Ramachandran and former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, where party workers shouted slogans of ""Chinnama Vaazhga,"" hailing Ms Sasikala.The trust vote was probably the first of many battles that the 63-year-old Chief Minister might have to fight.

""Even today when people speak of corruption, they speak of the previous government. Nobody is willing to even raise the issue against this government,"" he said.

Praising Modi, Jaitley said the country has a prime minister who has courage and capacity to take decisions.

He said unlike the previous government, this government does not believe in helplessness and allowing issues to persist.

""He (Modi) is even willing to take tough decisions and at times unpopular decisions, provided they are in the larger interest of the country,"" he said.

The minister claimed that on issues of national security, Modi had shown both clarity of mind and firmness which, he said, were attached to character and philosophy of BJP.

Stating that Kashmir has seen one of the worst ever crises, he said the 'strong leader and strong government' did not give a single signal that it is going to yield at the cost of national unity. ""That firmness finally paid off,"" he remarked.

Jaitley asserted that Pakistan had made routine activity of allowing its territory for terrorism against India and historically ""our response has been to raise it in international forum"" to isolate Pakistan.

""For the first time a government in Delhi has told the neighbouring country that if you indulge in terrorism in India, you will have to pay price for it and cost for allowing your territory to be used for terrorism will become unbearable on you.""

The opposition party targeted the Prime Minister for making big speeches on women's safety and law and order in Uttar Pradesh while ignoring incidents in states ruled by BJP including his home state of Gujarat. 

Mahila Congress chief Shobha Oza said, ""The party which raised the slogan 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' has senior leaders who have abused women. They can't or don't see the prevalence of gender violence in BJP-ruled states. For them slogans are more important than action. Why don't they raise the issues of gender abuse in BJP-ruled states?"" 

Oza cited the case of a Naliya girl who was gangraped by her employer who was a member of BJP and had alleged that she was drugged and raped by BJP leaders. 

She said, "" Congress party has been demanding a judicial probe through a sitting judge of the High Court to catch the culprits"". 

She said the party is not satisfied with the SIT probe into it as it is a ploy to save BJP leaders. 

""This is a sex scandal, where girls were abused for the pleasure of senior leaders and ministers. Whose names are coming up in connection to this horrendous event. BJP, RSS, VHP leaders and members. 

""The terrible incident in Kutch is one example. Many women were raped and pushed to prostitution. The situation is so bad and cases are constantly coming up,"" she said.

spoke on the security of women. ""But, when a woman was raped in a cab, PM Modi said 'Can't we remain silent. Why are we politicising this'. Prime Minister made women security an electoral issue. For BJP there are two standards,"" she said.

When the proceedings began today, the Congress MLAs created a din on the issue, prompting the Speaker Ramanlal Vora to adjourn the proceedings for an hour. 

While raising the gang rape case in the question hour, the Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar objected to the remarks made by the MoS for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja on black dresses worn by the Congress legislators yesterday, which was already expunged by the Speaker. 

As the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering, the Speaker once again adjourned the house for an hour. 

When the Assembly reconvened, the Leader of Opposition Shankarsinh Vaghela sought assurance from the government over the investigation into the case, saying they will allow the House to function only after such promise is made. 

Stepping in, Rupani said his government had taken a strict action against all the accused persons by arresting them immediately after the complaint was filed. 

""We have also arrested the BJP members named in the gangrape case and suspended them from the party,"" he said. 

Saying that nobody will be spared, Rupani asked Vaghela to give his suggestion on the probe and assured him of acting on it. 

To this, Vaghela demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge into the incident, however, the CM did not commit anything.

If the former BJP MP decides against contesting the elections, the Congress will field his wife from Amritsar East whilst utilizing his services in campaigning for the party candidates across the state. 
Subsequent to stopping the BJP in September a year ago, Sidhu had been in conversation with both the AAP and the Congress. However, his negotiations with the AAP broke down after the new party rejected his demand for naming a chief ministerial candidate ahead of the polls.

He had quit the BJP as well as the Rajya Sabha seat given to pacify him after denial of the party ticket for the Amritsar Lok Sabha election in 2014. His wife has already joined the Congress while his entry in the party was held up since he wanted Rahul to welcome him in the party while Rahul insisted on Punjab PCC chief and chief ministerial candidate Capt. Amarinder Singh induct him in the party. The party sources said Sidhu is most likely to contest the Assembly election from the Amritsar east that was held by his wife Navjot Kaur in the present Assembly as a BJP member.

His close aide and former Akali MLA Pargat Singh, who has joined the party with Sidhu's wife, too was not named in the list. The latest list has named 23 candidates but held back 17 of the most contentious names. This, even as the process of filing nomination papers has begun and will end on January 18. This included Amritsar East represented by Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur . Sources said Sidhu has refused to join the party till Pargat is given a seat of his choice. While Pargat prefers the Jalandhar Cantonment seat, it is believed that Congress wants to give him Nakodar near Jalandhar. Many in Congress feel that the brass has started flirting with danger with its cautious approach. They feel that if the last few names are delayed any further, candidates will get very little time to campaign. Also, there will be no elbowroom to firefight a rebellion if one breaks out. The situation is starkly similar to the 2012 election when candidates were announced at the 11th hour. Sticking to its 'one-familyone-ticket rule', the party will field Karmjit Kaur Chaudhary, wife of Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary, from Phillaur (SC), while from Samana it is Rajinder Singh, son of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee senior vicepresident, who will be fielded. Even though a section of party members were expecting Davinder Singh Gubaya, son of sitting Akali MP Sher Singh Gubaya, to be fielded against deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal from Jagraon, he has been nominated from Fazilka, on the third list, which consists of two women candidates, taking the total number of women to 10. Among the former Akali members, Kamaljit Singh Karwal, considered an aide of the Bains brothers in Ludhiana, has been chosen as the ""most suitable candidate"" to fight on the Congress ticket from Atam Nagar. Another ex-Akali member to find his name in the list is Pritam Singh Kotbhai from Bucho Mandi. Deepinder Singh Dhillon (Dera Bassi) and Rajwinder Kaur Bhagikay (Nihal Singh Wala-SC) are the other former Akali members on the list.

Srinagar, November 1
The opposition National Conference today launched a scathing attack on moderate separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, alleging him of proximity to the establishment and intelligence apparatus in New Delhi.
Mirwaiz Umar Farooqs proximity to the establishment and intelligence apparatus in New Delhi is a well-known fact and the National Conference does not require sermons from someone who is willing to break bread with intelligence officers in five star hotels in New Delhi, National Conference spokesman Junaid Azim Mattu said in a statement.
The NC spokesman said the separatist leaders numerous secret rendezvous with the high and mighty in New Delhi belied his moralistic press statements in Kashmir.
Mattu expressed amusement at, what he termed, Mirwaizs moral pretence of being outraged at his partys working president and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullahs speech at New York University last month.
Omar Abdullah has the courage and stature to say openly and unambiguously what Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is known to have advocated behind closed doors in New Delhi as was revealed by the Wikileaks, Mattu said. If Mirwaiz will like, we will be happy to share the exact dates and venues of his meetings with the high and mighty captains of the intelligence apparatus in New Delhi, the spokesman said.
The separatist group headed by Mirwaiz on Monday criticised Omar for showing concern over the future of Kashmiri children, accusing that a few years ago, he (Omar) didnt hesitate facilitating the killing of  120 youngsters.

In a scathing attack on the Mirwaiz, the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (NC) said it did not require sermons from someone who was willing to break bread with intelligence officers in five star hotels in New Delhi.

The Mirwaiz's proximity to the establishment and intelligence apparatus in New Delhi was a ""well-known fact"" and his numerous secret rendezvous with the high and mighty in New Delhi belied his moralistic press statements in Kashmir, NC spokesperson Junaid Azim Mattu said in a statement here.

He was reacting to the Hurriyat's statement on the speech of NC working president Omar Abdullah at an event at New York University recently where he said Pakistan has to first withdraw army from the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) before the United Nations resolutions on holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir are implemented.

Reacting to Omar's speech, the Mirwaiz had said his ""statement is along expected lines of double speak, hallmark of political parties supporting and promoting"" the consolidation of India's control of Kashmir.

The NC spokesperson said Omar had the courage and stature to say openly and unambiguously what the Mirwaiz is known to have advocated behind closed doors in New Delhi as was revealed by Wikileaks.

Omar's speech in New York is only what the Mirwaiz and many others consider to be historically accurate, Mattu said.

The NC spokesperson said the Mirwaiz should stop ""hoodwinking"" the people of Kashmir by hiding his own reluctance to call a spade a spade behind the sanctity of a genuine political sentiment in the state.

""NC believes the restoration of the pre-1953 status and granting of autonomy to J-K is a pragmatic and holistic political solution. Omar has reiterated this while speaking in New York and the party will continue to struggle for the solution we have striven for since decades.

We dont require sermons from Mirwaiz. Omar Abdullahs speech in New York is only what Mirwaiz and many others consider to be historically accurate even if what he has said is unpalatable to some. We all know how Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was exposed by Wikileaks when a US secret diplomatic cable revealed that Mirwaiz wanted the LoC to be converted into a permanent border and three separate legislative assemblies for Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir regions with Chief Minister and Governor from each region on rotation basis. The cable clearly said the Mirwaiz wanted this because he was concerned about his own political future. So its quite amusing why he is suddenly livid with anger at what Abdullah has said - not sure what he is trying to prove. Unlike Mirwaiz, what Omar Abdullah has said is based on his convictions and the unadulterated truth as opposed to Mirwaiz's personal political motives as the US diplomatic cables clearly highlighted, the NC Spokesperson further added. 
The NC Spokesperson said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq should stop hoodwinking the people of Kashmir by hiding his own reluctance to call a spade a spade behind the sanctity of a genuine political sentiment in the State. A man who dines with the high and mighty of the intelligence establishment in New Delhi should at least try to stay away from podiums of morality here.

496,PLTE068SRC001,"Concerned over Indiaâs dismal performance in Rio Olympics, where it could manage only two medals, the government is taking a serious note of Indiaâs poor track record in the highest sporting arena in the world. It has prepared a draft action plan where it has ambitiously targeted 50 medals in the 2024 Olympics. For this, the Niti Aayog has prepared a 20-point action plan where it has suggested that by prioritising 10 sports with high winning potential and in which India has won medals in the past, the objective can be achieved.

Incidentally, it has also praised the previous UPA regimeâs effort of cleansing the sports administration through the draft National Sports Development Bill, 2013, which the Manmohan Singh-led dispensation had unsuccessfully tried to get through in Parliament.

The strategy paper has come in the aftermath of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing in August that a task force for the next three Olympics would soon be formed to suggest measures to improve Indiaâs performance in the worldâs premier sporting event.

Sources privy to the development said that the PMO was disappointed with the fact that after bagging its richest ever haul of six medals in 2012 London Olympics, India, despite sending its largest ever contingent of 100 plus athletes, could manage only two medals in Rio. Subsequently, the government think tank came up with the strategy paper titled âLetâs Play â An Action Plan to achieve 50 Olympic Medals.â

The Niti Aayog as a short term strategy has suggested to the government that it is important to prioritise 10 sports and develop an outcome oriented action plan for each of these sports.

âCountries like Kenya and Jamaica participate in only two Olympics sports but have managed to get a medal tally of 100 and 78 respectively. The 10 priority sports should be ones with high winning potential as well as those in which India has won medals in the past. The action plan should be extensive in its coverage,â the Niti Aayog has recommended.

It (the plan) should include targets in the next four year cycle, training and coaching schedules to achieve those targets, medical, psychological and drug test schedules, institutional and private support systems for all categories of players of each sport. Each action plan should be reviewed after every 4 years and its outcomes assessed annually, the action plan suggests.

As part of long term measures, the Niti Aayog has underlined that the principle of âcatching them youngâ should be adapted.

âStudies suggest that a growing number of coaches, parents, and children believe that the best strategy to produce superior young sportspersons is to have them specialised in one sport from an early age. This strategy has produced successful young sportspersons across different countries in the recent Olympics. Chinaâs successful sportspersons in swimming had their talent identified at an age of 4 â 5 years. Similarly, the recent success of Germany in football has been attributed to successful youth academies of under-12-year olds,â it said.

Presently, the only provision India has to identify young talent is through Sports Authority of Indiaâs (SAI) National Sports Talent Contest, (NSTC) Scheme. The NSTC scheme scouts sports talent in the age group of 8 â 14 years from schools and nurtures them into future medal hopes by providing scientific training.

âHowever there is lack of awareness towards this scheme and lack of focus towards developing individual talent in the age group of 5 â 10 years.

The talent can be scouted through national level competitions for the priority sports. These competitions can start from the tehsil level across all schools and conclude at the national level. This annual competition across the 10 priority sports should be well publicized so as to reach all corners of the country. Both private and public schools should be allowed to participate.â the Niti Aayog has suggested.

It has also rued the fact that there is a lack of sports academies that target individual sport disciplines in India.",POLITICS
497,PLTE068SRC002,"Government's think-tank Niti Aayog has devised a short-term and medium-to-long term action plan to help India achieve 50 medals in 2024 summer Olympics.



The premier policy-making body said it is ""disappointing"" that the world's second-most populous country with world-class talent in various disciplines has not been able to produce champions in sports.



In its action plan for ""revitalising sports in India"", Niti Aayog said India still does not have a conducive environment for sports to polish the talent of Indian sportspersons and make them at par with their global counterparts.



""Efforts need to be undertaken at each level, from family and communities to schools, regional academies, states and national level. These efforts need to be aimed at radically increasing the level of sporting activities, filling the gaps in the system and monitoring for lags,"" it said.



Such efforts should help in overcoming existing societal barrier towards sports that can be summarised in the popular phrase, ""Kheloge kudoge to honge kharab, padhoge likhoge to banoge nawab"", it added.



The short-term vision (4-8 years) envisages targeting a group of priority sports, organising sportspersons into three groups for each priority sport, harnessing the potential of indigenous and regional sports, selecting world-class coaches as well as a grading system for coaches.



It will also focus on a sports injury insurance scheme, strengthening and scaling up of existing SAI training centres, facilitating creation of sports academies for individual sports, creating a digital database for sports, implementing national sports code and sports Bill and promoting revenue generating methods for team leagues of priority sports.



While the medium to long term vision (8-15 years) will focus on identifying talent at a young age, having sports curriculum in schools, a dedicated training programme for coaches, encouraging development of sports infrastructure through private or PPP mode and developing a health and psychological support division.



Stress in the medium to long term will also be on the consistent funding of contracts, hosting international events in priority sports as well as promoting a culture of sports in the country.



On funding of sportspersons, Niti Aayog said it has been observed that various sportspersons and/or sports academies receive erratic funding from one year to another.



To overcome this and provide constant support, it is recommended by the Aayog that after each Olympics, a fixed 4-year contract is signed between SAI (Sports Authority of India) and sportspersons from Group A sportspersons, keeping in mind the funding required by them up to the next Olympics and other international events in between.



For Group B and C also, the budgets for the next 4 years should be fixed, with consistent funding allocation for each year. Funding data for all the groups should be publicly made available as soon as it gets finalised, it suggested.",POLITICS
498,PLTE068SRC003,"NEW DELHI: Aiming for 50 medals in the 2024 Olympic games, the Niti Aayog on Wednesday released a 20-point action plan to hit the target.

Kant said the passing of the National Sports Code and Sports Bill, 2013, was long delayed and needed to be enacted at the earliest to ensure structural changes in policies.

The bill, has has been plagued by administrative and political bottlenecks and the absence of a consensus on fixing terms and tenures of sports administrators since 2013.

The bill seeks to fix the age limit of sports administrators. The action plan consists of short-term and long-term agendas to meet the target of winning 50 medals in 2024. The short-term vision is for 4 to 8 years, while the long-term vision is for 8 to 15 years.

The plan also recommends that the schools include sports as part of their curriculum and award marks, besides advocating equal pay for sports teachers. The performance in sports should be given equal priority as other academic subjects, the Niti Aayog said, while adding that the performance in sports can be added to the overall evaluation.

The Niti Aayog has also advocated that the age limit for training of sportspersons be lowered from the current 12 years to eight years. The planning body has also advocated encouraging and identifying children, as young as five, who show a talent in sports.

 Indian forces and police are beating and vandalizing humans, their residential houses, their vehicles, orchards, fruit and crop harvest, rice fields and other properties. Nowadays forces are going berserk and they are attacking humans and their properties but no one seems to care,â he said.

 The JKLF Chairman said that from last three months in general and from one and a half month in particular, nocturnal raids, crackdowns, arrest spree and booking innocents from 8-year-old to 85-year-old under black law Public Safety Act had become an order of the day and the whole occupied territory was reeling in pain but Indian civil society had maintained a criminal silence.

 Therefore, he said, our meetings with any Indian delegation or their arriving to enquire about my health at hospital is futile and worthless, and because of all these circumstances we thankfully and humbly reject their request of meeting.

 Yasin Malik termed as absurd and ridiculous the statement of pro-India National Conference leader, Omar Abdullah, in the US that resolution of Kashmir dispute could be found by turning the Line of Control into a permanent border. âKashmiris are suffering because of the hypocritical and double faced politics of these pro-India politicians who issue different statements at different places and try to undermine the freedom struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

 These hypocrites have no respect and regard for the sacrifices rendered by Kashmiris and they are deployed to safeguard the interests of Indian forces in Kashmir,â he added.âKMS",POLITICS
505,PLTE071SRC001,"NEW DELHI: Congress today demanded that a special session of Parliament be convened to declare Pakistan a terrorist state in the wake of the Uri terror attack.

It also alleged that the Narendra Modi government has responded only with ""jumlas (gimmicks) and rhetoric"" since the attack took place and favoured withdrawal of the most favoured nation status to Pakistan and imposition of economic sanctions on it.

""We believe extreme situation demands extreme decisions. By now, Pakistan should have been declared a terrorist state. They failed in that also,"" party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi told reporters, accusing the government of doing ""precious little"" to put Islamabad in the dock.

""We demand near absolute economic sanctions on Pakistan. There should be a special session of Parliament to discuss our security situation and declare Pakistan a terrorist state,"" he said.

The government's response to the attack has been only through ""rhetoric and jumlas"" and the Prime Minister's speech at Kozhikode demonstrated ""strategic ambiguity"". India is ""looking weak, having failed to deliver meaty blows"" to Pakistan, Singhvi said.

""We do not want this to lead to a strategic confusion, make India a laughing stock. It should not let the world think that India has an aimless political strategy. Aimless political strategy is not a synonym of strategic restraint,"" he said targeting the government.

Noting that Congress also believed in strategic restraint, Singhvi said that such restraint in the face of such provocation should not mean the absence of a strategic response.

""People of India want concrete actions against the rogue state of Pakistan,"" he said, adding the terror attacks at Uri and Pathankot have together taken a toll not seen in the last 20-22 years.

Rahul asked the Centre to fulfil the promise of UPA government and implement OROP at the earliest, saying it is the right of the armed forces, who have devoted their life to the country.

The suicide by an Army veteran over OROP has snowballed into a huge political show with Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other opposition leaders attacking the Modi government on the issue.

In the last two days the Congress MP was detained thrice to prevent him from leading a protest march over the suicide of an ex- serviceman, allegedly due to his grievances in implementation of OROP.

The commission, led by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Nasim Zaidi, was in Lucknow since Sunday to make a first-hand assessment of the preparations made by the state election machinery for the coming elections.

During a meeting with representatives of various political parties, Zaidi said they received several complaints alleging politicisation of state machinery, including the police by the ruling Samajwadi Party.

âThe EC believes that if effective action is taken at the level of police stations, all elections would be free and fair and voters will get the opportunity to turn up at the polling station to cast their vote,â Zaidi said.

The CEC said the Commission had also received complaints about sub-inspectors being made in-charge of the police stations under the patronage of political interests and pressure groups, and they take âbiasedâ actions. âThe EC has directed that the charge of police stations should be given to inspector-level officers,â he said.

Zaidi said the EC has decided to create a police station-level database that will have information such as number and type of offences that took place in previous Assembly elections, status of disposal of these cases, number of vulnerable locations and cases where voters had been threatened. âThe Commission and state machinery will use that database for effective control at police station level for ensuring free and fair polls,â the CEC said.

On the allegations of political parties about the partisan approach of the local police in vulnerable rural areas, who were threatening voters of a particular community under political influence, he said they would be taken care of and attempts would be made to check the use of money power with the help of enforcement agencies.

The parties had also demanded that the posting of âthanaâ level officials must be strictly reviewed and all officers known to be biased and influenced by political parties must be removed.

To a question that over 50 per cent police stations were being headed by the officers of a particular community, Zaidi said posting at police stations would be made as per the Election Commissionâs policy.

On the suggestion of political parties that central paramilitary forces should be deployed from outside the state before filing of nominations to prevent any attempts by the local forces to vitiate the poll process, the CEC said the Commission would try for their deployment in places where there are such apprehensions. Central security forces were earlier deployed at polling stations only on the poll day.

517,PLTE075SRC001,"World renowned economist and former Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh on Monday launched the Punjab Congress manifesto for the coming assembly elections with the confidence that the party, under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh, will undo the damage wreaked on the state by the Badal government. 
Pointing to the tremendous potential of Punjab, which remained unexploited due to the Badalsâ misgovernance over the past 10 years, Dr Singh said the state badly needed Captain Amarinderâs leadership at this juncture. Describing Captain Amarinder as a visionary, with a wealth of experience, Dr. Singh expressed the confidence that Punjab was in for a better time under the sate Congress presidentâs leadership. 
Dr. Singh described as a visionary document the manifesto, which Captain Amarinder said had taken six months of collecting inputs from all stakeholders, going down to the villages. Under Captain Amarinderâs rule, the state will see all-round development with revival of the economy, industry, agriculture and infrastructure, backed by higher income and equal distribution of wealth, said Dr. Singh. 
Among those present at the launch event were AICC leaders Ambika Soni, Asha Kumari and Randeep Surjewala, besides former Punjab Chief Minister and Manifesto Committee chairperson Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. 
In a first, the comprehensive 120-page manifesto was simultaneously launched by state party leaders Manpreet Singh Badal in Chandigarh, Maharani Preneet Kaur in Patiala, Sunil Jakhar in Bathinda, Vijay Inder Singla in Ludhiana, Dr. Amar Singh in Jalandhar and Rana Gurjit Singh in Amritsar. The manifesto was released in both English and Punjabi in online soft format, with hard copies of the same distributed to the media. 
The holistic manifesto, which addresses the concerns and aspirations of every section of the society, incorporates inputs from all cross-sections of the society, with Dr. Singh also having given his valuable suggestions. It was prepared by a 17-member manifesto committee, chaired by Bhattal and co-chaired by Manpreet Badal. 
Noting that the next government in Punjab would be taking over a deficit budget of over Rs. 5000 crore with huge debts, Captain Amarinder promised to bring growth back on track in the state through out-of-the-box thinking. 
Addressing mediapersons at the launch event at AICC headquarters here, Captain Amarinder said innovative measures such as cess on liquor and revenue through mining could help generate funds for employment, as promised by the Congress in its manifesto. With the promise of one job per household, the Congress has decided to take various initiatives, including the establishment of Employment Bureaus across the state under the supervision of an Employment Commission, to generate and provide employment to the youth, said the Punjab Congress president. 
Reiterating his promise to revive agriculture and industry in the state, Captain Amarinder said though farm debt was the responsibility of the central government, he would ensure that all debts of farmers in Punjab are waived off on priority basis. On the industrial front, he promised a level playing field for the industries and a series of steps for revival of industry in the state. He pointed out that his previous government had got an investment commitment worth Rs. 1.70 lakh crore, which could have led to the generation of 20 lakh jobs, but the process was scuttled by the Akalis when they took over the reins of the state. 
Responding to a query, Captain Amarinder said the war against drugs promised in the manifesto incorporated the thinking of INC Vice President Rahul Gandhi and he would break the back of drugs and hang those responsible for the menace. 
On the SYL issue, he announced that his government would introduce a legislation to protect the water of Punjab, which had not a drop to spare. 
In response to questions on his employment generation promise, Captain Amarinder asserted that he did not believe in making false promises and was confident of generating the 20 lakh jobs needed to ensure `one job per familyâ in Punjab. 
Revenue generation would be augmented through unique initiatives to boost the stateâs financial health, without mortgaging assets like the Badal government had done, he said, pointing out that the SAD-BJP government in the state had mortgaged even schools, mental hospitals and old age homes to compensate for the losses to the state exchequer resulting from their corruption and mismanagement. 
Both Dr. Singh and Captain Amarinder agreed that demonetisation would be an issue in Punjab, along with other issues plaguing the people of the state. Dr. Singh expressed concern at the impact of demonetisation on GDP. 
Captain Amarinder said the Congress manifesto, which covers every section of the society, was a realistic document, unlike that of the AAP which was making separate manifestos that could not possibly be implemented. Reiterating that the Congress manifesto was sacrosanct and would be executed in totality, Captain Amarinder said neither AAP nor the Akalis, who had not fulfilled even 20% of the promises made last time, were serious about the welfare of Punjab. 
To another question, Captain Amarinder confirmed that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be contesting in the Assembly elections on Congress ticket from Amritsar East.

Insiders say that Dr Singh has given key inputs to Congress' Punjab unit to chart out the blueprint for party's plan for job creation and increasing investment - domestic and international- in the state. 
After the announcement of poll dates, Captain Amrinder Singh while talking to India Today had stated that the main emphasis will be to bring the state back on growth track and main challenge for the next government will be revive the economy and generate employment in the state. 
DRUGS ERADICATION 
There will be special emphasis on how to handle drug menace in the state. A special stringent law to punish those involved in drug trade might find a mention in the manifesto. 
The manifesto will focus on the schemes related to welfare of farmers and defence forces. Captain Amarinder during his campaign had promised loan waiver - which is estimated to be around Rs 37,000 crore - to the farmers. 
GREEN CLEAN PUNJAB 
The manifesto will also focus on the environmental concerns. Party sources said that right from increasing green cover, cleaning Sutlej and Beas rivers, management of depleting groundwater to setting up of a separate Punjab State Environment Commission which will be responsible for managing environment related issues, all will find a place in the manifesto. 
For Jawans (soldiers), the party has included a 21-point agenda for them in the manifesto.

The Congress manifesto is likely to be released at six places: in New Delhi with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh doing the honours, and simultaneously in Chandigarh, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Bathinda. 
Sources said the cover of the manifesto will bear the slogan âNavan Naroa Punjab Liayie, Captain Di Sarkar Banaiyeâ along with pictures of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Capt. Amarinder Singh. The inclusion of the last named effectively settles the question of whether he will be formally named the chief ministerial candidate of the party.

One of the nine main points is the promise to create one job per family. The partyâs final list of election candidates is likely to be out in a day or two with decisions on 40 seats yet to be taken. The party has so far declared candidates for 77 out of the total of 117 seats in the Assembly. The strong resistance to giving tickets to those who joined the party recently has delayed the announcement. Sources said that among the leaders who joined the party recently, Pargat Singh, the former India hockey captain who defected from the Akali Dal, wants the ticket from Jalandhar (Cantonment) but the party wants him to fight from Nakodar. Former Akali Dal minister Sarvan Singh Phillaur wants the ticket from Phillaur but Punjab Youth Congress chief Vikramjit Chaudhary also wants that seat.

âTwo and a half years ago, Modi had promised jobs for youths and Rs 15 lakh in the account of every citizen. But he has failed to fulfil his promises. Farmers, labourers, small shopkeepers and defence personnel are the worst affected but the government is unmoved,â he said.

I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVPâ. 
Now in another shocking revelation, an ABVP member and a student of Kirori Mal College, said she was harassed by Left activists. Speaking to Hindi News 18 , the girl who is also an NCC cadet, said that there were around 60-70 students there and her clothes were torn. She said she was hit on her chest in front of everyone, and her clothes were ripped apart.

The clashes had erupted after an invitation was sent to JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar on âCulture of Protestsâ which was withdrawn by the college authorities following opposition by the ABVP. 
âWe are of the view that these attacks on women protesters by policemen may also amount to molestation and need to be severely punished.

âFurther, the Commission is aghast to read newspaper reports alleging that Delhi Police claims it does not know who ordered the lathi charge on the protesters. Such statements raise suspicions about politicisation of police and the matter needs to be investigated urgently,â it added. 
DCW Chief Swati Maliwal has pointed out in the notice that a similar âmanhandlingâ of female students by policemen had happened last year when they were protesting in connection with the case of missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed.

Facing death and rape threats after her social media campaign against the RSS student wing, Kaur, daughter of an Army officer killed in the Kargil war, was compared to underworld don Dawood Ibrahim by a BJP MP while Union Minister Kiren Rijiju wondered who was ""polluting"" her mind. 
But Kaur got the endorsement of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and many others for her stand against the ABVP and violence on the campus. The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) urged the police to act against those threatening her. 
Kaur, a student of the prestigious Lady Shri Ram College, insisted she won't be intimidated. 
""I am not afraid because I am fighting for the right thing,"" she said, adding she was getting numerous threats on phone and social media besides filthy comments. 
""It would be very nice if I get protection. Fear is not in my blood. My father took a bullet for the country and I am also ready to do that,"" she added. 
Kaur, 20, told the media that nobody had the right to threaten any woman with rape. 
Kaur took on the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, which controls the Delhi University Students Union, after ABVP activists were blamed for the attacks on students, teachers and journalists in the campus. 
Students opposed to the Ramjas College violence of February 22 and the online threats against Kaur have decided to take out a march in the Delhi University on Tuesday. 
The issue triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress. 
""Criticise the government but don't abuse the motherland,"" Rijiju said, after Kaur also posted: ""Pakistan did not kill my father. War killed him."" 
BJP MP Pratap Simha from Mysuru posted an image of Dawood on Twitter with the words ""I didn't kill people in 1993, bombs killed them."" 
The MP added: ""At least Dawood did not use the crutches of his father's name to justify his anti-national stand."" 
Both Rijiju and Simha faced widespread flak. 
Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Against the tyranny of fear we stand with our students. For every voice raised in anger, intolerance and ignorance there will be a Gurmehar Kaur."" 
Said Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari: ""An atmosphere is being created to protect those who support violence or are fascist in nature. But those who try to express something within the limits of the Constitution, they face violence.""

The post on Facebook read: ""The brutal attack on innocent students by ABVP is very disturbing and should be stopped. It was not an attack on protesters, but an attack on every notion of democracy that is held dear in every Indian's heart. It is an attack on ideals, morals, freedom and rights of every person born to this nation. The stones that you pelt hit our bodies, but fail to bruise our ideas. This profile picture is my way of protesting against the tyranny of fear.""

Use the hashtag #StudentsAgainstABVP and copy paste this message along with it. It's time for every student of India to unite! Jai Hind! Jai Democracy!"" 
Support for the campaign started pouring in soon after the message was posted on Facebook.

The members of the Joint Action Committee (JAC), seeking justice for Rohith at UOH, are going to mark the day as Rohith Shahadath Din (Rohith's Martyrdom Day) inside the campus of the institute. 
Speaking to reporters, mother of Rohith, Radhika, appealed to students, rights activists and sympathisers to extend their solidarity by visiting the university campus to mark his death anniversary.

Rohith Vemula's suicide on January 17, 2016 sparked massive protest in the university campus, followed by top political leaders from all parties converging on campus demanding justice.

Parties need to rise above politics and take decision for the sake of the country,"" the BJP MP from Unnao had said in Meerut, sparking a controversy barely four days after Supreme Court made it illegal to seek votes in the name of religion or caste. 
The FIR was registered under IPC sections 298 (Uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 295A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class) and 153b (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) among others. 
The BJP has distanced itself from party MP Maharaj's controversial comment, saying it is not the view of the ruling party nor that of the NDA government at the Centre. 
As the comments by the MP from Unnao in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh drew strong condemnation from the opposition parties, the Election Commission sought a report from Meerut district administration, while the Congress said it will file a complaint against the MP before the election watchdog. 
""The commission has sought a report from the Meerut administration in connection with the statement issued by Sakshi Maharaj on Friday,"" the Chief Electoral Office said. 
Speaking to CNN-News18, Maharaj sought to defend his statement, saying he did not target any particular community. ""I have not commented on any community. I have been misquoted and am ready to face Election Commission,"" he said. 
""I had said that the population of India is approx 132 crore. India's landmass is not increasing but our population keeps on increasing. We need to control this menace. We should respect women and I had said that she is not a machine, that is why 40 wives, 40 kids and triple talaq are no longer tolerable. We need to take a decision whether we should have one, two, three or four kids. But we need to take a decision on this,"" PTI quoted him as saying later. Jansakhya badh rahi hai,zameen utni hi hai. Maine kaha aurat machine nahi;4 biwi,40 bache,3 talaq nahi chalenge-Sakshi Maharaj on his stmnt.
The controversial remarks comes close on the heels of the Supreme Court making it clear that no person can seek votes in the name of religion and caste. 
Flaying the comments, JD-U leader KC Tyagi termed them as the first major violation of the Supreme Court guidelines on use of religion in politics. Hume to inaam milna chahye hum 4 bhai hain or chaaro sanyasi hain toh bache karne ka koi sawal hi nahi hai: Sakshi Maharaj on his statement.
""Recently the Supreme Court and the Chief Election Commission laid down some guidelines for model code of conduct, including not to use religion, caste and language. This is the first major violation by a major political party that is BJP, by its MP. Now action must be taken by the party as well as the Election Commission against Sakshi Maharaj. 
""They are making derogatory comments against one section of the society. This is violation of Model Code of Conduct to incite one section against another. And this is a criminal act,"" he said. 
Congress leader KC Mittal said Sakshi Maharaj's speech is ""offensive"" as it is based on caste and religion and goes against the recent Supreme Court judgment. ""It is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct and Congress is officially filing a complaint against him in the Election Commission,"" he said. 
Asked about the comments, BJP leader and Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, ""I haven't seen his statement, but we believe in taking everyone along. Country runs on law, on Constitution, it does not run with stick. 
""Such statements or views are not of either BJP or government. We have nothing to do with such statements, he said. 
Asked about Congress reportedly planning to take up the issue with Election Commission given model code of conduct is in effect in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Naqvi said ""It is wrong to perceive his statement as that of the BJP.""

AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala. (Photo: PTI) 
New Delhi : AIADMK General Secretary V K Sasikala was on Tuesday convicted by the Supreme Court that set aside the Karnataka High Court verdict acquitting her in the 19-year-old disproportionate assets case that also involved late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa. 
A Bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Amitav Roy, who had reserved verdict on June 7, 2016, gave the verdict in the case. The bench sentenced Sasikala to a prison term of four years, and imposed a fine of Rs 10 crore. 
The AIADMK general secretary now cannot become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, or contest elections for 10 years, which includes the four years of prison term. 
The apex court has directed Sasikala surrender immediately and serve over 3 years of her remaining prison term. 
A bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Amitav Roy, who had reserved the verdict on June 7, 2016, gave the verdict in the case on Tuesday. 
Subsequently, police reached the Golden Bay resort outside Chennai to arrest Sasikala. 
âAmmaâs sanctity has been defiled by betrayers,â the AIADMK's Twitter handle said after the SCâs verdict against Sasikala. 
The apex court with its verdict restored in toto the judgement and the findings of the trial court in Bengaluru which had held guilty all accused including Sasikala's two relatives, V N Sudhakaran and Elavarasi. 
The matter escalated to the Supreme Court after the Karnataka High Court had on May 11, 2015 ruled that Jayalalithaa and Sasikala's conviction by special court suffered from infirmity and was not sustainable in law, clearing decks for Jaya to return as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister. 
The SC bench read the operative portion of the voluminous judgement saying, ""according to the material and evidence placed on record, we set aside the judgement and the order of the high court and affirm in toto the judgement and order the trial court convicting the accused persons."" 
The bench said since Jayalalithaa had expired, the proceeding against her was abated. 
""Nevertheless, we reiterate that having regard to the facts, the charge framed against them by the trial court is restored,"" the bench said. 
In a separate but concurring judgement, Justice Amitava Roy said, ""We have expressed deep concern about the escalating menace of corruption in society."" 
On June 7 last year, the apex court had reserved its verdict in the case after hearing detailed arguments from all the parties including the Karnataka government which was appealing the acquittal by the Karnataka High Court. 
On July 27, 2015, the apex court had issued notices on the Karnataka government's appeal seeking stay of the high court judgement on Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and her relatives. 
The special court had in 2014 held Jayalalithaa guilty of corruption and sentenced her to four years imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 100 crore. 
Jayalalithaa and three others were accused of allegedly amassing disproportionate asserts to the tune of Rs 66.65 crore during her first term as Chief Minister from 1991 to 1996. 
Sasikala has been involved in a long and protracted power struggle with acting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam for the CM's post, following Jayalalithaa's death. 
Sasikala appointed one of her loyalists EK Palanisamy as leader of the AIADMK Legislature Party, following her conviction. Soon after, O Panneerselvam was expelled from the party. 
Sasikala still holds the majority, with 123 of 134 MLAs still in her camp. She has moved a number of MLAs to Koovathur resort near Chennai, where they have been staying for several days. Sasikala on Monday stayed overnight at the resort. ",POLITICS

New Delhi: Sasikala Natarajan (60), the AIADMK general secretary, faces a moment of judgment in her quest for power in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday at 10.30 a.m. when the Supreme Court is due to pronounce her as guilty or not in a disproportionate assets case. This relates to Rs 60-crore assets acquired by her as a shared fortune with late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa whom she served as live-in aide for years. 
The Bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Amitava Roy, who reserved the judgment after completing nearly four months of hearing on June 7, will be ruling on the appeal by the Karnataka Government against the acquittal of both Jayalalithaa and Sasikala by the High Court in Bengaluru. 
Both were jailed in Bengaluru in 2014 on the charge of acquiring the real estate and jewellery worth Rs 60 crore beyond declared sources of income. Also Read: Sasikala must leave her flock free 
If Sasikala sails through, she will have to face another trial in the Tamil Nadu Assembly to prove her majority in less than a week as her claim to have the majority of MLAs with her has been challenged by Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (66), a Jayalalithaa loyalist who had filled in as CM twice during her incarceration as he has vowed not to allow Sasikala to replace him. 
Both Sasikala and OPS on Sunday rushed to the Raj Bhawan to greet Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, also the Governor of Maharashtra, on his turning 75 on February 12, but he carefully kept mum on their power struggle and he may now go by the Centreâs advice, delivered through Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, to order a special session of the Assembly for a composite floor test within a week. What this means is that all of Tamil Naduâs 234 lawmakers will meet to decide who has the majority â Sasikala or Panneerselvam â by declaring their support in writing. 
However, if the Apex Court overturns the High Court verdict and holds Sasikala, along with Jayalalithaa, guilty of amassing the wealth through corrupt means, it may end her political career as she faces jail and prohibition from contesting the elections for six years. The verdict wonât mention Jayalalithaa since she died in December. 
The Governor kept everybody guessing about his decision for the last five days but he has dropped hints that he does not favour letting Sasikala take oath as the CM before the Supreme Court decides on whether she is guilty of graft. 
Sasikala is not an MLA and hence she has to contest and get elected to the Assembly within six months to continue as the CM even if she is acquitted and wins the trust vote in the Assembly. She has already parked 127 AIADMK MLAs in a resort on the outskirts of Chennai for the past six days while OPS has been so far able to garner open support of only seven MLAs. Sasikala needs 117 votes in the House. As such, she has a comfortable margin unless there is a mass exodus to OPS on the day of the voting. 
Agency reports say Police on Monday told the Madras High Court that the MLAs assured them that they were not held hostage in the resort as alleged by the OPS camp. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Monday to direct the Governor to administer oath of office to Sasikala to form the government within 24 hours. Another petition fixed for hearing on February 17 may become infructuous as its prayer is not to allow swearing in of Sasikala before the Court decides the corruption case against her.

543,PLTE084SRC001,"Going whole hog after Election Commission's nod to his coronation, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav revoked expulsion of nine MLCs and youth wing leaders, sacked for indiscipline earlier by his warring uncle Shivpal Yadav. 

The decision to revoke their expulsion was a foregone conclusion though formal orders to this effect were issued late last night, taking them back in the party fold.
This is the first major decision taken by Akhilesh as the SP national President.

Nine leaders including MLCs Ananad Bhaduaria, Sunil Singh Sajan, Sanjay Lathar, Mulayam Singh Youth Brigade national and state president Gaurav Dubey and Mohammad Aibad were expelled in September last by then state president Shivpal after he replaced nephew Akhilesh on the post in a bitter power game.

Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha state chief Brajesh Yadav and his counterpart in Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha Digvijay Singh, who were also sacked on charges of indiscipline after they led an agitation demanding restatement of Akhilesh, are also back in the party.

MLC Udaiveer Singh, who was expelled for attacking Mulayam alleging he was under influence of ""outsiders"", too is back.

MLC Arvind Yadav, nephew of SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, against whom allegations of ""land grabbing"" was made by Shivpal while being sacked, has also been taken in.

Akhilesh also appointed Geeta Singh as the state president of SP Mahila Sabha and restored youth leaders back to their their previous posts.

On Monday, Election Commission has settled the dispute over Samajwadi Party's name and symbol 'bicycle' in the UP CM Akhilesh's favour.Taking full control of the ruling party after being crowned as its head at a disputed national convention here on January 1, Akhilesh has been going all out consolidating his grip over the organisation.

He has already made new appointments of district chiefs and also released list of candidates for the Legislative Council polls in his capacity as the SP chief.

Akhilesh appointed heads of 11 district party units in Mainpuri, Moradabad, Fatehpur, Etawah, Farukhabad, Hardoi, Firozabad, Deoria, Kushinagar, Azamgarh and Mirzapur.

The existing presidents of these district units were sacked with immediate effect to pave the way for new faces to demonstrate the chief minister's strengthening grip over the party.

Presidents in all these districts were dumped by Shivpal, who is state president of another faction of SP backed by Mulayam, his elder brother.

Apparently to send the message that he was in the driver's seat as 'president' of SP, Akhilesh has cleared the names of three candidates for the biennial elections to UP upper House for Kanpur-Unnao (Teachers constituency), Allahabad-Jhansi (Teachers constituency) and Bareilly-Moradabad (Graduates constituency).
These constituencies will go to polls on February 3.

544,PLTE084SRC002,"After Election Commissions Monday verdict installing UP CM Akhilesh Yadav as SPs national party, things are fast returning to normal. Akhileshs sulking uncle Shivpal Yadav, who was the CMs main rival in the intra-family feud and who was showing his reluctance to contest elections, finally agreed to contest from his traditional Jaswantnagar seat. 
On the other hand, Shivpals son Aditya on Wednesday tweeted for unity in the party. Shivpals name was added to the list of 45 candidates handed over by SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav to Akhilesh Yadav who is finalising the party candidates in consultation with party general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav for the polls. Initially, Shivpals name was missing in the list of Mulayams 45 candidates sent to Akhilesh for consideration. 
Instead, his (Shivpal) son Aditya Yadavs name was recommended from Jaswatnagar constituency. As per reports, Shivpal was not interested in contesting as he was looking towards a role for himself in national politics. 
But later, elder brother Mulayam prevailed over him and revised his list to include Shivpal from Jaswantnagar striking out Adityas name on late Tuesday night. Shivpal has been representing Jaswantnagar in state Assembly since 1996. 
I will contest elections, said the beleaguered ex-state chief of SP while talking to media persons on Wednesday morning. Shivpal was removed from the post of partys state unit chief at the national convention which anointed Akhilesh SPs national president and Mulayam party patron on January 1. Later, Akhilesh appointed veteran Samajwadi Naresh Uttam as SP state unit chief. According to sources, Mulayam, on late Tuesday night, indicated that he would neither field his men against Akhileshs candidates nor would launch a new party if his son accommodated the names suggested by him in final SP list for the UP elections. 
Meanwhile, Shivpals son Aditya Yadav came out in Akhileshs support through a tweet, whereby, he made an appeal for partys unity and also posted pictures of his father along with Mulayam and CM Akhilesh.

Until Monday, he was the SP heavyweight, the one who posed the most serious challenge to his nephewâs claim to the party crown. But the morning after the Election Commission awarded the cycle poll symbol of the SP to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Shivpal Yadav cut a lonely figure, deserted by the last of his loyalists. 
Standing outside the Vikramaditya Marg residence of SP patriarch and brother Mulayam Singh Yadav , Shivpal only had a handful of supporters with him. Ticket hopefuls who walked up to him turned back disappointed when Shivpal told them: âTicket hum nahin, Mukhya Mantri de rahe hainâ (The Chief Minister is distributing the tickets, not I). 
His interactions were brief, suggesting his helplessness at the turn of events, the fact that he no longer had any âauthorityâ left in the party. When some of the workers shouted âShivpal Singh Yadav zindabad, Aditya bhaiyya(Shivpalâs son) zindabadâ, Shivpal hushed them: âI will forward your applications to Netaji (Mulayam Singh) and the Chief Ministerâ¦ Jisko bhi party ticket de, usko chunav ladanaâ¦ aur jeetana (will be our job).â 
He refused to speak to reporters, telling them he would do so in a day or two. 

To all in Lucknow, it was clear that Shivpal was out in the cold at the end of the bitter family tussle for control of the party. Elated over the award of the party symbol, Akhilesh was making up with Netaji and there was talk that father and son were working on the distribution of poll tickets â Akhilesh said 90 per cent of the names in the lists they had drawn earlier were common. 

Shivpal was no longer in the picture. His residence, where tight security would restrict entry, was an open house Tuesday â people walked in and out without being asked questions. Anyone who wanted to meet Shivpal could simply walk to the lawns where he waited. 
No party leader was visible â in all these years, he was always surrounded by senior ministers, bureaucrats, businessmen and organisation leaders.

546,PLTE085SRC001,"NEW DELHI: Senior advocate and Congress member Kapil Sibal requested the Supreme Court on Wednesday to widen the ambit of election laws to curb canvassing of votes using religion since the use of information technology had pushed campaigning to a new level.
Drawing from his experience in the political battlefield, Sibal said rapid evolution of internet and mobile phones and their use in campaigning did not require a candidate to use religion any more in his speeches.
""The candidate is assisted by an army of campaigners who bombard voters with communal messages inciting passion. Politicians know the voters' caste, community, religious and linguistic demographic division. They have mastered the art of inciting passion using each segment without saying a word in public,"" he said.
""T he court must keep the new-age tools and internet in mind while interpreting Section 123 of Representation of the People Act. Giving a restrictive meaning to the law and fastening liability only when a candidate uses religion, caste, community or language to seek votes would only encourage the use of proscribed elements in elections,"" he added .
Sibal said constitutional ethos did not permit any harm to the secular fabric of the country by mixing of religion and politics.
The bench said, ""The heart of Indian politics is on the basis of discrimination on the basis of caste and religion, Scheduled Castes and Tribes. So how can religion and caste per se be an anathema to politics?""
Sibal said, ""Making an election speech for protection of Scheduled Castes, Tribes or welfare of minority would not fall foul of Section 123 of RP Act as the Constitution itself talks of government taking steps for welfare of these groups. Technology may have changed the campaigning, but can a candidate be held liable for every post on social networking sites or other electronic medium?""",POLITICS
547,PLTE085SRC002,"Religion or caste is a key part of India's political discourse, the Supreme Court observed today and asked whether seeking of votes on that basis would amount to ""corrupt practice"" under the election law. 

The apex court asked whether a candidate or a party, seeking votes in the name of religion, caste or tribe by promising that this would help protect and improve the voters' lot as a community, would be a ""corrupt practice"".



The court, which is examining the scope of section 123(3) of the Representation of the People (RP) Act that deals with electoral malpractices amounting to ""corrupt practices"", said the issue of prevalent religion and caste-based discrimination was a key part of the political discourse in the country. 

""What is wrong if a candidate or a party says that Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) are not secure and he asks them to vote en masse for him as he will protect them,"" a seven-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur said. 

""Does it amount to corrupt practice if a candidate appeals for votes to a community on the basis of their religion and the aim is to better their lot,"" the bench, also comprising Justices M B Lokur, S A Bobde, A K Goel, U U Lalit, D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, asked. 

During the day-long hearing, the bench reiterated its yesterday's observation that it would not re-visit the famous 'Hindutva' verdict holding Hinduism as a 'way of life' as the issue did not find mention in the reference made to it by a five-judge bench. 

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who argued for one of the respondents in the case, referred to various constitutional schemes including fundamental rights and said sooner or later, the apex court will have to re-visit the entire issue to put an end to caste and religion-based politics in the country. 

Seeking widening of the scope of Section 123(3) of the RP Act, Sibal said: ""In an election, who are being targeted? It is the voters"". 

Hence, the term -- ""his religion"" -- in the provision should not remain confined to the candidates only but should include the faith of the electors as well, he conended.
During the hearing, the bench observed that the heart of 

politics in the country was discrimination based on caste and religion and the ""appeal (for votes) should be in furtherance of the constitutional goals."" 

Sibal also referred to Section 153A (promoting enimity between classes) of the IPC and said a person is liable for criminal prosecution if he or she promoted hatred among communities. 

""But how far is it rational that a candidate, who promotes hatred among communities for seeking votes during election, cannot be accused of resorting to corrupt practices under section 123(3) of the RP Act,"" he asked. 

""Politicians have become hardened and learnt the art of garnering votes on the basis of religion and caste and this practice should must stop,"" Sibal said, adding that arousing the passion of a voter in the name of his religion during election process should be held corrupt practise. 

""We should not live in the make-believe world as the modes of communications are changing and the term 'corrupt practice' should be seen in the context of enduring constitutional ethos and the changing times,"" Sibal said. 

He referred to various provisons of the Constitution dealing with fundamental rights and other aspects and said ""these elements of constitutional ethos have to be respected while interpreting Section 123(3) of the RP Act"". 

Sibal cited provisions dealing with prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth, equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, abolition of untouchability, freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion, freedom to manage religious affairs or religious worship in certain educational institutions. 

The ""mischief"" which the court is seeking to deal with relates to ""identity polity"" and laws should be interpreted with changing times, he said, adding that now, social media has a vast reach and campaigns were being carried on them. 

He also asked the bench to consider whether a candidate could remain insulated from his political party which has some ""divisive agenda"" in its manifesto.
Sibal said ""sometime, there were subtle, sometimes 

indirect and at times direct ways of seeking votes in the name of religion, race, caste, community and language"". 

He said the five-judge bench had wrongly held that the manifesto of a political party could not be attributed to its candidates. 

""We have confidence in this court,"" he said, adding that the caste and religion-based politics has to end. 

The bench said one way of interpretation was that the term 'his religion' meant the religion of the candidate and a third person, seeking votes in the name of religion for a candidate, cannot be expressly held to be indulging in corrupt practice. 

The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue tomorrow. 

Yesterday, the bench had ruled out re-visiting the famous 'Hindutva' verdict holding Hinduism as a ""way of life' making it clear that it would not go into the ""larger debate"" as the issue did not find mention in the reference made by a five-judge bench. 

Section 123(3) of the RP Act, which is being scrutinised, reads: ""The appeal by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language or the use of, or appeal to religious symbols or the use of, or appeal to, national symbols..., for furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate"" would amount to corrupt practices. 

Social activist Teesta Setalvad had earlier sought to intervene in the matter with an application stating that religion and politics should not be mixed and a direction be passed to de-link religion from politics. 

The bench is hearing a batch of petitions including the one filed by Abhiram Singh whose election as an MLA in 1990 on BJP ticket from Santacruz assembly seat in Mumbai was set aside by the Bombay High Court. 

The apex court in February 2014 had tagged Abhiram Singh's petition with others in which the five judge bench had decided in 2002 to re-visit its 20-year old 'Hindutva' judgement for an authoritative pronouncement on electoral laws by a seven-judge bench.
The issue of interpretation of section 123(3) arose on 

January 30, 2014 before a five-judge which referred it for examination before a larger bench of seven judges. 

A three-judge bench on April 16, 1992 had referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench Singh's appeal in which the same question and interpretation of Section 123(3) was raised. 

While the five-judge bench was hearing this matter on January 30, 2014, it was informed that an identical issue was raised in an election petition filed by Narayan Singh against BJP leader Sunderlal Patwa and the another Constitution Bench of five judges of the apex court had referred it to a larger bench of seven judges.

Recently, the Supreme Court has observed that religion or caste is a key part of Indias political discourse and that grabbing votes in the name of religion is evil and corrupt practice. The SC has asked whether a political party or a candidate, seeking votes in the name of religion, caste or tribe by promising that this would help protect and improve the voters lot as a community, would amount to corrupt practice under the election law.
However, the apex court declined to hear a plea by social activist Teesta Setalvad to check the devastating consequences of its 1995 judgement defining Hindutva or Hinduism as a way of life and not a religious practice. The five-judge bench reiterated its observation that it would not re-visit the famous Hindutva verdict holding Hinduism as a way of life as the issue did not find mention in the reference made to it.

Misreporting by Media on Seven Member Constitutional Bench

This is a Seven Judge Constitutional Bench looking at the crucial issue of Section 123(3) of the Representation of Peoples Act which is-at election time-the section of the law to create a wall of separation between Religion and Politics and enforce and ensure the Constitutional Mandate of Secularism. One of the aspects of the Reference being heard is that of the wrong interpretation in our view that an appeal to Hindutva is not an appeal to religion. Yesterday the CJI/Bench passed an oral observation saying two things. One that Religion in Politics is the ultimate evil in a secular state and that they may not go into the Hindutva not being Religion in this reference. No where was my IA discussed. The media is unfortunately irresponsibly collapsing the issue. Our IA stands and we will be heard as Intervenors. Today or Tomorrow. Indira Jaisingh appears for us.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who argued for one of the respondents in the case, referred to various constitutional schemes including fundamental rights and said sooner or later, the apex court will have to re-visit the entire issue to put an end to caste and religion-based politics in the country. Seeking widening of the scope of Section 123(3) of the RP Act, Sibal said: In an election, who are being targeted? It is the voters. Hence, the term  his religion  in the provision should not remain confined to the candidates only but should include the faith of the electors as well.

The court, which is examining the scope of section 123(3) of the Representation of the People (RP) Act that deals with electoral malpractices amounting to corrupt practices, said the issue of prevalent religion and caste-based discrimination was a key part of the political discourse in the country. What is wrong if a candidate or a party says that Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) are not secure and he asks them to vote en masse for him as he will protect them, a seven-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur said. Does it amount to corrupt practice if a candidate appeals for votes to a community on the basis of their religion and the aim is to better their lot, the bench, also comprising Justices M B Lokur, S A Bobde, A K Goel, U U Lalit, D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, asked.",POLITICS

The Commission rejected the argument that the information was âpersonal informationâ and thus cannot be disclosed. 
âThe Commission directs the respondent authority, the CBSE, to facilitate inspection of relevant records and provide certified copies of documents selected by the appellant free of cost, except personal details in admit card and mark sheet, within 60 days from the date of receipt of this order,â Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order. 
Acharyulu was recently divested of the charge of HRD ministry but retained CBSE by Chief Information Commission RK Mathur barely few days after he ordered inspection of BA records of Delhi University pertaining to 1978, the year in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi passed out. 
Rejecting CBSEâs argument that it was a personal information, Acharyulu said it is not correct to say that once a student passes an examination and qualifies to secure a certificate or degree, information about result will be his personal information. 
âDisclosure of the details of a particular candidate contained in the degree or certificate register cannot cause any unwarranted invasion of privacy of the certificate holder,â he said. 
The Information Commissioner said if admit card contains personal information like address, contact number and email id, it is the personal information of the candidate and need not be given. 
âThe CPIO has not put forward any material or justification to say that such disclosure of academic qualification related information shall cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of Smriti Irani in this case,â he said.

Acharyulu said the academic institutions while awarding such academic qualification certificate for class 10th and 12th are discharging their statutory duties and registering the qualification details.

âSmriti Zubin Irani being an elected MP and holding the Constitutional office of the Union Minister, is a public authority under RTI act. Under the RPA, 1951 she must have fulfilled her statutory responsibility to submit an affidavit declaring educational status.

564,PLTE091SRC001,"CHENNAI: After its hope of getting a berth in the DMK-led alliance turning futile, the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) on Tuesday announced that the party will go itÂ  alone in the civic polls.

A visibly distraught party president GK Vasan made the announcement, having waited for seven days for a positive signal from the DMK after his meeting with MK Stalin. âThe preparatory works for facing the local body polls are being done well in all the districts,â he told reporters.

Replying to question on why the move to forge ties with DMK failed to fructify, he said the Dravidian party had made its stand over its alliance partners five days ago.

Sombre mood prevailed at the TMC headquarters in Teynampet here, with the morale of the leaders and cadre drooping since the DMK had left them stranded. Party leaders sounded philosophical and looked resigned to what they are destined to in the October 17, 19 polls.

âWe have to go to the polls on our own strength. We will muster all our strength and try to win as many seats as we can in places where we have support,â said a TMC leader.

The Congress putting up stiff resistance to the entry of its splinter group is believed to have tilted the scales against TMC, as DMK chief M Karunanidhi vetoed his son and party treasurer MK Stalin who was keen to have TMC on board. Itâs like beign caught in the crossfire, said party leaders.

The task is cut out for TMC as it has to toil a lot to win at least a few seats in the civic polls.

The predicament of the party now seems to be one resembling the Assembly polls. Then, the TMC had hoped to board the AIADMK front but the later's insistence of contesting on the two-leaves symbol came as roadblock. With DMK not showing interest, Vasan had no option but to seek the company of PWA-DMDK combine, eventually drawing a blank.

âWe constituted a viable alliance and faced the Assembly polls with a view to establish a polite, peopleâs welfare oriented alternative in the State. It had better response in the beginning. Lack of enough time to take our ideals to the people left us losing,â Vasan explained.",POLITICS

Party chief Vasan said that efforts had been on in the party for the last three months to face the local-body polls single-handedly.

""Based on that, now a conducive atmosphere has emerged for us to face the local body polls by ourselves..Preparations are underway in the local units,"" for this purpose, he said.

He had joined the DMDK-PWF combine to take forward ""decent"" and ""alternative politics"" but the alliance failed in the elections as it did not have the time to reach out to people with its stated objectives, Vasan said in a statement.

Vasan's TMC had joined hands with Vijayakant-led DMDK and the four party People's Welfare Front (PWF), whose constituents are MDMK, CPI (M), CPI and VCK.

Referring to his attempts to stitch a pact with DMK for the local body polls, being held in two phases next month, he said that ""we made an attempt in lines with the desires of the local leaders,"" but did not specify why the efforts did not materialise.

Party chief Vasan said that efforts had been on in the party for the last three months to face the local-body polls single-handedly.

""Based on that, now a conducive atmosphere has emerged for us to face the local body polls by ourselves..preparations are underway in the local units,"" for this purpose, he said.

He had joined the DMDK-PWF combine to take forward ""decent"" and ""alternative politics"" but the alliance failed in the elections as it did not have the time to reach out to people with its stated objectives, Vasan said in a statement.

Vasan's TMC had joined hands with Vijayakant-led DMDK and the four party People's Welfare Front (PWF), whose constituents are MDMK, CPI (M), CPI and VCK.

Referring to his attempts to stitch a pact with DMK for the local body polls, being held in two phases next month, he said that ""we made an attempt in lines with the desires of the local leaders,"" but did not specify why the efforts did not materialise.

Vasan had recently called on DMK Treasurer M K Stalin, triggering speculations of an alliance for the local body elections.

Batting for equal rights for Muslim women, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he favoured the discontinuation of 'triple talaq' (oral divorce).
Addressing a rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh's Mahoba area in Bundelkhand, the Prime Minister said, ""Lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be destroyed by triple talaq.""
""Is it fair for a man to say talaq thrice over the phone and a Muslim woman's life is ruined?"" he asked, urging the political parties not to politicise the issue.
""I am surprised that for vote bank politics, some parties want to keep Muslim women bereft of their natural rights,"" the PM said.
NOT A HINDU-MUSLIM ISSUE
Modi said triple talaq should not be seen as a communal issue. ""I request people who participate in TV debates to not make women's rights into a Muslim -Hindu issue. Women's rights is a development issue,"" he said.
Modi said it was for this reason that his government has told the Supreme Court that inequality cannot be allowed in the name of religion.
Modi also said that justice demands that the government works as per the Constitution and provides gender justice for everyone. He added that this issue should not be seen through the prism of a community and rather with the good intention of bringing about equality for all.
The Law Commission recently sought public views on abolition of the practice of triple talaq among Muslims and on the contentious Uniform Civil Code, triggering a feverish debate in various quarters.

""Female feticide is a sin. So what if the sinner is a Hindu. My government has taken a number of steps (to stop this practice). Daughters, mothers, sisters should be protected. One should not consider religion. Mothers and sisters should be respected. We have raised the issue+ firmly.
""Now the issue of talaq has come up. Just like if any Hindu commits female feticide he will have to go to jail, similarly what is the crime of my Muslim sisters that some one says talaq over phone and her life is destroyed,"" he said addressing a ""Maha Parivartan Rally"" here in the Bundelkhand region in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.
Urging TV news channels to not turn triple talaq into an issue of Hindu versus Muslim or BJP versus other parties+ , Modi said that in its submission to the Supreme Court, the central government had clearly stated that there should not be any atrocity on women and there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion.
""In democracy, there should be discussion. The government has put forward its position. Those who want to digress from triple talaq are instigating people...in the country, lives of Muslim women cannot be allowed to be ruined by triple talaq,"" he said.
In his speech, the Prime Minister asked the audience whether the rights of Muslim women should be protected or not and whether they should get equal rights or not?
""I am surprised that some political parties of the country in their lust for vote bank are hell-bent upon committing injustice to women in the 21st century. What kind of justice is this?
""Politics and elections have their own place but getting Muslim women their rights as per the Constitution is the responsibility of the government and the people of the country,"" he said.
Asking the media to not turn the issue of triple talaq as a matter between the government and the opposition, Modi said, ""The debate should be between knowledgeable persons from Muslim community knowing 'Quran'. In Muslim community, knowledgeable and progressive people are there. There are educated Muslim women who can put their views forth.""
""When you do TV debate do not turn it into Hindu-Muslim issues. Debate should be between those who want change in Muslim society and those who do not want 125 crore Indians to know what is the issue,"" the Prime Minister said.

573,PLTE094SRC001,"For the first time since the Atal Behari Vajpayee government of over a decade ago, India will undertake the strategic sale of state-owned firms. The Union Cabinet, at its meeting Thursday chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, granted in-principle approval to the Niti AayogÃ¢ÂÂs proposal for the strategic stake sale in over a dozen public sector undertakings (PSUs), including some which are making profits.

The government will give up management control in these PSUs as the Centre plans to bring its stake in these firms to under 50 per cent. The PSUs listed for a strategic sale will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

The Cabinet also approved the closure of the loss-making HMT tractor division by offering VRS to its employees at the 2007 notional payscales.

Ã¢ÂÂThe recommendations of the Niti Aayog with regard to both disinvestment and strategic sale came up for consideration. In principle, the Cabinet has approved the recommendations with regard to some of the units,Ã¢ÂÂ said Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. He said the names of PSUs that will be up for strategic stake sale will be made public once they are to be put up for auction.

Ã¢ÂÂSome of these are important units and therefore, since each unit will be considered in its own merit, the timing of that would be decided by the government accordingly,Ã¢ÂÂ Mr Jaitley said. While evaluating the valuation of these companies, the government will also take into account its immovable property and other assets. Mr Jaitley said that to arrive at a valuation of these PSUs, the government would follow settled, transparent valuation processes.

The PSUs listed for strategic sale will be considered by the Cabinet separately after it had been examined by the department of disinvestment and the relevant ministries.

The department of investment and public asset management will work out the methodology, price fixation and base price for each PSU that is up for strategic sale.

Ã¢ÂÂSo in principle it has been approved. Specific cases will now come up after a detailed examination on how it is to be done in each case, and details with regard to the units concerned will be furnished at that stage. This list does not include PSUs for closure,Ã¢ÂÂ he said. On the timeline for sale, the finance minister said he was not going to allow it to Ã¢ÂÂbe under-sold merely because there is a calendar limitationÃ¢ÂÂ.

Asked whether the government will meet the Rs 20,500-crore strategic stake sale target for the current fiscal, Mr Jaitley said Ã¢ÂÂat the moment we are at the mid-point of the year, and this year we have already made a significant headwayÃ¢ÂÂ. The government has already raised over Rs 8,000 crores through PSU share buybacks and OFS (offer for sale). It intends to raise Rs 36,000 crores in the entire fiscal through minority stake sale in PSUs.

The PSUs identified for strategic sale by the Niti Aayog reportedly include the profit-making Bharat Earth Movers and Certification Engineers International as well as loss-making Scooters India.

The last strategic sale of a PSU was Jessop and Co in 2003-04 under the NDA government headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee, when 72 per cent of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs stake was sold to Indo Wagon Engineering for `18.18 crores. During 1999-2000 and 2003-04, the NDA government had strategically divested its stake in 16 PSUs, garnering Rs 6,344.35 crores.

The first strategic sale in a PSU also took place under the Vajpayee government in 1999-2000, when it sold 74 per cent equity in Modern Food Industries to Hindustan Lever for Rs 105.45 crores.

""We have decided to intensify our strike from tomorrow. All shops will remain closed. Fish sellers too have joined us and are extending support to us,"" Lucknow Bakra Gosht Vypar Mandal office bearer Mubeen Qureshi said. 
He said, in the wake of the crackdown, there was no question of the strike being called off anytime soon. 
""It will go on indefinitely,"" he said. 
Due to the strike, non-vegetarian food outlets, including the famous Tunday and Rahim's have shifted to mutton and chicken dishes after buffalo meat became scarce. 
""The meat sellers are piqued over the crackdown on slaughter houses which has adversely hit the livelihood of lakhs of people,"" Qureshi said. 
After coming to power, the Aditya Nath Yogi government has ordered closure of illegal slaughterhouses and strict enforcement of the ban on cow smuggling to fulfil a key electoral promise.

""But there will be no compromise on the quality of the food,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
At the same time, he supported the closure of illegal and mechanised slaughter houses in the state, saying it was difficult for a common man to pass through a locality where the slaughter houses were operating almost openly. He also alleged that the illegal abattoirs even indulged in slaughtering dogs. 
Replying to a question, he said, ""This is not a religious issue. In fact, it is directly linked to the health of people, who have the right to good quality of meat and fish."" 
Meanwhile, BJP national spokesman Sambit Patra said in Delhi that the government was only following a court order as illegal abattoirs were contributing to UP's ill health by getting ground water polluted. 
He claimed those running meat outlets legally and in accordance with norms were not being victimised. 
""There has been a court order about illegal abattoirs which was not implemented by the previous government. The state's Chief Secretary has constituted committees in each district headed by the Collector and comprising ten people each. The committee is visiting every slaughterhouse to see if they are being run legally and submitting a report every day,"" he said.

""How is it that the small shops are getting closed and meat exports are going up. The government should have made people aware of the laws and rules before launching the drive,"" he said. 
Chief Minister Aditya Nath Yogi had yesterday said abattoirs operating legally will not be touched but action will be taken against those run illegally.

Meat sellers in the sprawling Uttar Pradesh, however, allege that police were raiding the shops and forcing the closure of their establishments despite having valid licences.

""Providing people of the state with a corruption-free government and bringing about a major change in the lives of the poorest of the poor as targeted by the Prime Minister will be our priority,"" he told reporters. 
He was elected in the presence of party observers and senior leaders from Delhi- Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Saroj Pandey, Dharmendra Pradhan, Shyam Jaju and JP Nadda- as well as Uttarakhand BJP president Ajay Bhatt. 
Rawat will be sworn-in as the eighth Chief Minister of the hill state at a grand ceremony at the Parade Grounds in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. 
Party sources told news agency IANS that six ministers were also likely to be sworn-in with Rawat. 

Meanwhile, in-charge of the party's affairs in the state Shyam Jaju described Rawat as the most suitable choice for the new responsibility since he was a leader who had both organisational and ministerial experience having served as BJP's organisation secretary and a minister. 
""Trivendra Singh Rawat is a leader who has both organisational and ministerial experience. He is perfectly equipped to give the state the kind of leadership it needs, "" Jaju said. 
A former associate of now Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rawat was Agriculture Minister in the previous BJP government in Uttarakhand, which was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000. 
Elected from Doiwala, where he defeated Congress`s Hira Singh Bisht with a margin of over 24,000 votes, Rawat is widely regarded in the party for his organisational skills. He is a `Pracharak` in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). 
Besides being closely associated with Modi when the present Prime Minister was a BJP general secretary, Tomar also worked with Amit Shah in Uttar Pradesh during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. That was when the BJP created history by sweeping 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, leaving only five to the opposition and two to an ally. 
Rawat, a Thakur, was among the front-runners for the post and is largely credited with the BJP win in Jharkhand where he oversaw the party`s Assembly polls in 2014. 
In the just-concluded Assembly Elections, the BJP stunned the Congress by winning 57 of the 70 seats in Uttarakhand. 
Rawat will be the fifth BJP chief minister in Uttarakhand. The party formed its first government in the state when it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000 with Nityanand Swami as the first Chief Minister. Swami was replaced by BJP`s BS Koshyari in March 2001. 

The Congress won the first election in the state in 2002 and ND Tiwari headed the government. The BJP returned to power in 2007 with BC Khanduri as Chief Minister. Ramesh Pokhriyal replaced Khanduri in 2011. 
In 2012, the Congress formed the government after a nail-biting finish with the BJP in the Assembly Elections that year. Vijay Bahuguna was made the Chief Minister but he was replaced two years later by Harish Rawat in 2014.

580,PLTE096SRC002,"The BJP on Friday named Trivendra Singh Rawat as its chief minister designate in Uttarakhand. 
The party elected him as the leader of the BJP legislature party and he will take oath on Saturday at the Parade ground in Dehradun. 
The CM designate Trivendra Singh Rawat met Governor KK Paul and claimed the support of 57 MLAs to form government. 
The BJP scored a massive victory in Uttarakhand winning 56 of the 70 seats in the state to storm to power, reducing Congress to a minuscule minority in the state Assembly with a poor tally of 11 seats. 
An RSS veteran, since 1979, Trivendra did his post-graduation in journalism. He was appointed as an Uttarakhand organisational secretary for five years in 1970. Rawat also served as state cabinet minister in 2007 under BC Khanduri. 
Coupled with his administrative and organisational skills and experience, his loyalty to the party and RSS ideology seemed to have won the day for him. 
So impressed was Home Minister Rajnath Singh with his unflinching devotion that while asking people to vote for Rawat, he had said, ""Trivendra Singh Rawat ne kabhi apni nishtha nahin badli (he never switched his loyalty)."" 
The ringing endorsement by the fellow Thakur leader from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh seems to have worked for Rawat, 56, who wrested the Doiwala seat from Congress with an impressive margin of 24,869 votes to win it for the third time. 
His organisational skills were put to test in Jharkhand where he came out with flying colours, guiding the BJP to a resounding electoral victory in the assembly polls in 2014 as party in-charge. 
Born in December 1960 into a family where serving in the armed forces was a tradition, with his father Pratap Singh Rawat in Garhwal Rifles, he studied in a school built of mud and thatch in his native village of Khairasain in Pauri Garhwal district. 
Though average in studies, Rawat evinced keen interest in socio-cultural work at an early age, a fact which explains his joining the RSS aged 19 years. 
Six years later, he was appointed RSS pracharak for Dehradun city. 
Considered a man rooted in rural traditions, Rawat loves hill delicacies and keeps visiting his village from time to time to relish those, especially during winter when he loves to eat millet (Manduwa) rotis, his elder brother Veerendra says. 
Shyam Jaju, BJP Uttarakhand in-charge, informed that PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah will attend the swearing-in ceremony of Trivendra Rawat.

All the 57 newly-elected legislators of the BJP have been asked to come to the state capital between Friday and Saturday to partake in the swearing-in which is likely to be a grand affair as the party has swept back to power after five years and that too with a landslide majority. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah along with select ministers from the Union government and central office bearers are likely to be present at the oath taking ceremony. 
Security arrangements are being made at the Parade Grounds, keeping in mind the VVIPs who will attend the event, an official informed IANS. Senior police and district officials along with some BJP legislators have been visiting the venue to oversee arrangements for the Saturday event. 
The newly elected lawmakers of the BJP are likely to meet later on Friday to elect their new leader who will also be the next Chief Minister of the state. BJP president Amit Shah has named two central observers - Saroj Pandey and Narendra Tomar, to oversee the election of the new legislature party leader.

Music composer Vishal Dadlani on Wednesday met Jain monk Tarun Sagar and apologised to him in person for his sarcastic tweet on the spiritual figure that had kicked up a storm.

The monk asked him to seek forgiveness from the Jain community for hurting their sentiments.

After the composer apologised as per the Jain communityâs tradition of seeking âPanch Mafeeâ that included holding of ears, Sagar said though he had already forgiven Dadlani, now he would appeal to the community to forgive him and withdraw protest against him and treat the matter as closed.

In a letter to Modi on Tuesday, Yechury pointed out âthe alarming increase in the non-performing assets (NPA) of state-owned banksâ and the central governmentâs âreluctanceâ to recover these bad loans, while at the same time âhoundingâ the farmers for petty amounts even in drought years.

âRecent reports show that bad loan provisioning for most state-owned banks doubled â and even trebled in some cases â in 2015-16. There has been a lack of concerted effort to recover these bad loans, and your government has instead waived Rs 59,547 crore of bad loans of big borrowers in 2015-16,â Yechury said in the letter.

âAll this while, the farmers continue to be hounded for repayment of minor amounts in drought years,â he stressed.

The CPI-M leader said that the big borrowers have âviable assets which can be easily recovered by banks, if backed up with political will and determinationâ.

âInstead, we have seen a proposal to divert all the bad loans from state-owned banks by creating a single âbad bankâ. It is an attempt to portray a clean-up of bank account books by diverting the bad loans to a separate new entity, which will still be government owned,â Yechury said.

âThis âbad bankâ will still be furnished by public money as all the other banks will be recapitalised by your government, while big borrowers would be allowed to go scot free at the cost of the honest tax-payer.â

âThis amounts to the cronies being rewarded for their profligacy, bad business practices and their lavish personal lifestyles by the hard earned savings of the vast majority of the middle classes and the poor of this country,â he said.

Yechury pointed out that a proposal to create a âbad bankâ was publicly rejected by former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan.

He had identified the âmoral hazardâ problem of this proposal, where the banks would continue to lend to the same big borrowers who would display scant regard for returning these loans.

âBefore any attempts at whitewashing the bad loans by recapitalising the banks, the principle of âRecovery First, Recapitalise Laterâ must be followed in letter and spirit of your government. To not do so would confirm our worst fears of your government â which has written off Rs 1,12,089 crore of loans of big borrowers â being beholden to crony capitalism,â Yechury said.

594,SOCE001SRC001,"Petrol pumps across India will stop accepting debit and credit cards from Monday to protest what the petroleum dealers call an ""irrational and sudden"" move by banks to charge 1% transaction fee on every payment accepted by card. 

The banks' move will not target the citizens directly as no new charges will be levied on customers using cards. 

But if petrol stations continue with cash-only operations, it will certainly inconvenience lakhs of vehicle owners given the paucity of cash in the system. 

The non-acceptance of credit/debit cards at petrol stations comes at a time when the Centre is pushing for increased non-cash transactions, and close on the heels of its announcement of a 0.75% cashback offer on purchase of petrol using cards. 

Speaking to TOI, BR Ravindranath, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders and Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said: ""They (banks) must apologise to the public."" 

Stating that the profit of all petroleum dealers are determined by the oil marketing companies (OMCs), which have fixed the net profit at 0.3% to 0.5%, Ravindranath said: ""If the banks straight away levy a 1% transaction fee, where do they expect us to go.

Sale of petrol/diesel is highly regulated and we cannot fix our own rates in view of this sudden levy by banks. So our best option is to not accept cards."" 

On whether punishing people is the right attitude, Ravindranath said: ""We do not have control over how much profit is fixed for us, or at how much we can sell petrol at. When the OMCs fix all of that, they are now washing their hands of this problem. When we contacted George Paul (the person co-ordinating on behalf of OMCs), he says it is between us and the banks and that we should sort it out."" 

Stating that the decision has been taken unanimously by all petroleum dealers in the country, Ravindranath said there is no question on going back on this. ""This is not a protest to withdraw, it is a question of our survival and we cannot just function like this. It will be all cash until banks withdraw the transaction charge.""

A sudden move by banks to levy a 1% transaction fee on card payments at petrol pumps have taken the oil ministry by surprise and prompted dealers to say they will stop accepting plastic money from Monday, which could inconenience consumers in times of cash shortage and affect the government's move to expand the cashless eco system in the country. 

In Delhi, ministry officials said even they were unaware of the move by the banks and have asked them to put off the levy till a system of compensating the petrol pump dealers is disccused by all stakeholders -- state-run fuel retailers, banks and petrol pump owners. The banks' move will not target the citizens directly as no new charges will be levied on customers using cards. 
Stopping card payments and accepting only cash at petrol stations comes at a time when the Centre is pushing for increased non-cash transactions and announced a 0.75% cashback offer on purchase of petrol using plastic money. 
ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank sent notices to dealers on Saturday night to inform them about the surcharge. These banks together cover most of the petrol pumps that have POS (point of sale or card swipe machines) in the country. 

Following the notice, pump owners took the decision to stop accepting card payments at a meeting of all petrol pump dealers' associations in Bengaluru on Sunday. All India Petroleum Dealers Association president Ajay Bansal told TOI from Bengaluru said all pump owners are firm in their decision to withdraw card swipe machines from intervening midnight of Sunday and Monday. 
""They (banks) must apologise to the public,"" B R Ravindranath, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders and Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, told TOI in Bengaluru. 
Dealers say the transaction fee by banks will will wipe out their profit, which is set by the state-run fuel retailers. Ravindranath claimed the net profit, after deducting all operational costs, stand at at 0.3% to 0.5%. ""If the banks straight away levy a 1% transaction fee, where do they expect us to go. It becomes extremely difficult to survive in such circumstances,"" Ravindranath said 

The dealers also appear to be aware of the damage that can be caused to their public image due to their protest but claim they have no other choice. ""The public will see us as the villains now. They will think we are inconveniencing them by demanding only cash, but the truth is not that. Sale of petrol/diesel is highly regulated and we cannot fix our own rates in view of this sudden levy by banks. So our best option is to not accept cards,"" the manager at a Bangaluru petrol pump said.

596,SOCE001SRC003,"Petrol pumps across the country will not accept credit and debit card payments for fuel sales from tomorrow after banks decided to put transaction (MDR) charge on them instead of consumers. 

To promote cash-less transactions, the government had waived the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on fuel purchase post demonetisation for consumers. But after the expiry of the 50-day window, the banks have decided to levy MDR on petrol pump owners. 

Petrol pump owners association said they have been ""informed by HDFC Bank that we will be charged 1 per cent on all credit card transactions and between 0.25 per cent and 1 per cent on all debit card transactions from January 9, 2017. The same will be debited to our account and net transaction value will be credited to our account"". 

Ajay Bansal, President, All India Petroleum Dealers Association, said the bank has quoted RBI circular of December 16, 2016, for its action. 

""Unfortunately, the circular has no reference to credit card charges or for not passing the same to the customers. We feel that HDFC Bank is using this as an excuse to improve their bottom line through transactions at fuel stations,"" he said. 

He said petrol pump margins are fixed on a per kilolitre basis and do not have any scope to absorb these charges. 

""We have specific mechanism to compute the margin and these do not have any scope for credit card MDR. This will lead to financial loses for the dealers,"" he said, adding that credit card machine issuers are also delaying settlements of dues. 

Also, there are disputes about purchases being returned or not delivered. ""In a retail outlet, there is no scope for returns or not being delivered a product once you have paid for the same. The reconciliation of swipes to amount being credit to our accounts is causing a lot of hardships and loses to a large percentage of the dealer community."" 

He said the petrol pumps have ""decided to stop accepting payment through credit/debit cards from January 9, 2017"". 

""All POS (point of sale) machine issuing banks who are not charging the same and are willing to adhere to existing commercial arrangements should correspond with us to let us inform our members to continue with accepting cards on their machines,"" Bansal said.

597,SOCE003SRC001,"BJP Government Bans Slaughter of Cattle Across the Country 
BANGALORE , May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 
According to the new rule, the sale of slaughter of cattle - including bulls, bullocks, cows, buffaloes, steers, heifers, calves, as well as camels -- has been banned across the country. 
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160817/398863LOGO ) 
In a controversial move that is set to have far-reaching effects, the Ministry of Environment and Forests has announced a nationwide ban on the sale of cattle for slaughter, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 
This would mean that the bovine animals will only be sold to agriculturalists, who will have to provide authentic documents in order to buy them. These agriculturalists also have to submit a written declaration to the Animal Market Committee that they will not resell the animals for the purpose of slaughter. 
There are certainly benefits to this move. A study in the United States has suggested that cutting down on beef and replacing it with beans would be hugely beneficial for the environment, as it would reduce carbon footprint. 
However, a move as drastic as this could have a significant impact. The country has seen a large number of attacks by the so-called ' gau rakshaks' in recent times, with the Dadri lynching of 2015 being the most prominent. The Government's latest announcement is set to anger many, including minorities and meat traders. India being the largest exporter of beef in the world. 
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is himself understandably against the new rule, and has vowed to go to the court to contest the decision, arguing that citizens should have the right to decide what they will and will not eat. 
In a scathing indictment, he opined that consumption of beef should not be based on religion. He also suggested that the centre should focus more on preventing attacks on those who transport cattle rather than banning the slaughter of cattle. 
This means that ordinary people's eating habits as well as livelihood are going to be affected, mainly those of minorities such as Muslims and dalits, as beef is such an integral part of their lives.

Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Published:January 23, 2017 4:20 am Assam Police DG Mukesh Sahay rushed to Tinsukia to take stock of the situation and hold a security review meeting with the Army. 
In the first attack on security forces in the northeast by militants this year, two jawans of the Assam Rifles were killed and three others injured when a group of heavily armed ULFA and CorCom militants ambushed them near Jagun in Tinsukia, close to the Arunachal Pradesh border on Sunday morning. Two militants were also killed in retaliatory fire by security forces. 
Following the ambush, security forces closed down NH315 between Jagun and Lekhapani in Assam to conduct combing operations, leaving over 1,000 tourists stranded at Nampong in Arunachal, where they had gone to attend the Pangsau Pass Winter Festival over the weekend. A government official said that the visitors, mostly domestic tourists, were safe. 
Nampong in Changlang district is 20 km from where the ambush took place on NH315, about 35 km from the Myanmar border, beyond which the ULFA, NSCN(K), NDFB(S) and several Manipuri rebel groups are believed to have their bases. NH315 is part of the Indian stretch of the 1,736-km historic Stilwell Road that starts from Ledo in Assam, passes through Myanmar and ends in Kunming in China. 
âA road-opening party of the Army came under sudden attack on the National Highway near Jagun, leading to the deaths of two security personnel. Troops immediately rushed to the spot and killed two militants in retaliation. The incident occurred at around 7.30 am on Sunday,â said Assam Police (Special Branch) additional director-general Pallab Bhattacharyya. The militants also took at least three weapons, including an AK-47 rifle, from the jawans. 
Bhattacharyya said that the Paresh Barua faction of ULFA and Meitei militants under the umbrella group CorCom were behind the ambush. âThe two militants that the troops eliminated soon after the ambush belonged to CorCom,â said Bhattacharyya. At least one G3 rifle has been recovered from the slain militants, he said. 
The two security personnel killed in the ambush have been identified as Rifleman Ben Naitha and Rifleman K Wangshu, both from 13 Assam Rifles based at Jairampur. 
Assam Police DG Mukesh Sahay rushed to Tinsukia to take stock of the situation and hold a security review meeting with the Army. 
The ULFA, in a press statement sent by e-mail, claimed that the attack was carried out by UNLFW and CorCom under the directives of ULFA vice-chairman Paresh Barua and CorCom chairman MM Ngouba. The statement signed by self-styled Captain Arunudoy Asom, assistant publicity secretary of ULFA, also claimed that they had killed three Army jawans. 
The United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) is a conglomerate of the Paresh Barua faction of ULFA, Khaplang faction of NSCN, NDFB(S) and KLO, with six Manipuri rebel groups joining it under the banner of CorCom.

609,TERE004SRC001,"A lone gunman killed five people and injured eight Friday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which was forced to shut down and thrust into chaos as a false report of a second shooter sent passengers scrambling about an hour after the first shooting. 
The suspected gunman was identified as Esteban Santiago, law enforcement officials told the Miami Herald. He is thought to have been a passenger on a flight from Canada that landed at FLL at around noon with a checked gun in his baggage. 
After retrieving his bag, Santiago is believed to have gone into the bathroom and loaded the weapon. Then he stepped into the Terminal 2 baggage claim area and began shooting. 
Santiago was carrying some form of military ID. He is suspected of being a former U.S. Army soldier from the New York area. 
After the initial shooting, which took place just before 1 p.m. local time, the Broward Sheriffâs Office (BSO) reported it had arrested a man suspected of opening fire inside a baggage claim area. He was thought to be a lone shooter. 
About an hour later, a second gunman was reported â erroneously, as it turned out â at a different airport terminal, causing panic and sending dozens of passengers fleeing across the tarmac as police in armored gear responded with drawn weapons. Police and passengers at the terminal took cover behind parked cars. 
Broward Sheriff Scott Israel reported that only the first incident, in Terminal 2, was a shooting. The second incident, in Terminal 1, involved a person injured during the airport evacuation, Israel said. 
Israel said the suspect, whom he declined to name, was arrested unharmed. 
Passengers had panicked after the BSO and the Transportation Safety Administration said a second shooter might be at large and urged people at the airport to shelter in place. Some people rushed out of the Terminal 1 arrivals area, some with their hands up. 
U.S. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who was briefed by TSA and FLL officials, first identified the suspect as Santiago, and said Santiago carried some sort of military ID. 
Court records show that Santiago had minor brushes with the law when he lived in Alaska, including a $1,000 fine for driving without insurance and another infraction for driving with broken tail lights. 
An Anchorage landlord evicted him last year for failure to pay rent. 
In January, he was charged with misdemeanor counts of property damage and assault. That case is ongoing. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment. 
Santiago has no criminal record in Florida. 
President Barack Obama was apprised of the shooting Friday afternoon, the White House said. President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence spoke to Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who was en route to Fort Lauderdale. 
âJust spoke to Governor Scott,â Trump wrote. âThoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!â 
The second incident alarmed passengers already rattled by the earlier bloodshed. BSO deputies sat people down on the curb between Terminals 1 and 2. Then, very suddenly, the deputies all ran across an access area and huddled behind parked cars. A BSO deputy screamed âGet down!â Then another deputy looked at people gathered above the departures level and yelled for everyone to get back. 
Jason Perez, a Southwest Airlines employee who checks passengersâ bags outside Terminal 1, was among a crowd of dozens standing outside the terminal after the shooting in Terminal 2 when a crowd fled out of the departure lobby and began running toward him and across the car lanes outside the terminal. 
âWe just seen a stampede of people running toward us,â he said. 
âThis is crazy,â he said as an alarm went off and a womanâs calm voice told everyone to remain calm. 
One live shot at 2:45 p.m. showed hundreds of travelers walking along railroad tracks east of the airport â many of them walking with their hands above their head to show they were not carrying a weapon. 
Police reported receiving the first call that shots were fired at the airport at 12:55 p.m. The initial shooting caused passengers to flee the baggage claim area and brought the airport to a standstill as flights were temporarily grounded and roads around the airport were closed to traffic. 
As security tightened around the airport and Miami International Airport, federal officials said the FBI had dispatched a terrorism task to investigate the shooting in Fort Lauderdale. But there was no indication yet that the incident is related to terrorism. 
Mike Leverock, an FBI spokesman, said agents were working with local authorities in response to the shooting. 
Eyewitnesses at the airport began to post photos and other messages on Twitter shortly after the shooting, including one image that showed a person bleeding profusely while seated in a corner outside of the terminal. 
Mark Lea, who said he was a witness to the shootings, told MSNBC that the shooter was a man, wearing a Star Wars T-shirt, and that he walked into the baggage claim area of Terminal 2 and opened fire with a single handgun. 
Lea said the man said nothing as we he went through three magazines before giving up and sprawling spread-eagle on the flood as a police officer took him into custody. 
âHe had no intention of escaping,â Lea told MSNBC. 
Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who worked for President George W. Bush, tweeted that he was at the airport and âshots have been fired. Everyone is running.â 
On the ground, police closed roads leading into the airport, bringing traffic to a standstill on I-595 East just east of I-95. Two buses, ambulances and multiple police cruisers could be seen on the airportâs tarmac and throughout the arrival and departure areas. 
With armored vehicles and squad cars, BSO blocked the entry to the arrivals level of FLL. Cruisers with flashing lights are stationed around each terminal on the upper departure level. 
A source close to the situation confirmed to the Herald that Customs Border Patrol and a group of Homeland Security agents from Immigration Customs Enforcement were using a Black Hawk helicopter to provide aerial support in search of additional shooters. 
No TSA employees were hurt during the shooting, said spokesman Mark Howell. 
Howell said all passengers in Terminal 2 will be asked to exit and go through security again. 
âThere will be major delays,â Howell said. âWe are bringing in extra resources but they are having a hard time getting in there because of the traffic snarls.â 
The Fort Lauderdale airport, which does not have its own police force and relies on BSO for law enforcement, handles about 800 flights a day and 25 million passengers a year. In 2014, the Transportation Security Administration reported making 49 gun seizures at the Fort Lauderdale airport â tied with Tampa International Airport for the seventh most gun seizures in the nation. 
In the wake of the shooting news, Miami-Dade officials said they beefed up security at MIA and PortMiami, its two main travel hubs. County spokesman Michael HernÃ¡ndez said âout of an abundance of cautionâ the county was instituting âenhancedâ security at both county-owned facilities. 
Those include a checkpoint at the entrance of the PortMiami tunnel off the MacArthur Causeway and additional police officers patrolling the port and airport. 
Though the number of officers at MIA has not increased, their presence was high profile, said Suzy Trutie, an MIA spokeswoman. Many police were carrying long rifles out in the open. And police officers were posted inside terminals and on the airportâs perimeter. 
âJust really being on high alert,â Trutie said. 
Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez said he has his folks on standby in case theyâre needed in Fort Lauderdale. 
Heâs placed the seaport and MIA on high alert, the highest security level possible unless feds become involved here. 
âAs an abundance of caution, weâre treating it as a worst-case scenario,â he said.

610,TERE004SRC002,"A gunman, apparently acting alone, opened fire at random on passengers in a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport Friday, killing five people and injuring eight, before being taken into custody, according to law enforcement authorities. 
Witnesses said the male shooter emptied several magazines of bullets, then dropped to the floor spread-eagled to await arrest. He was taken into custody without incident by a Broward County sheriff's deputy, according to Sheriff Scott Israel. 
âPeople started kind of screaming and trying to get out of any door they could or hide under the chairs,â a witness, Mark Lea, told MSNBC. âHe just kind of continued coming in, just randomly shooting at people, no rhyme or reason to it.â 
Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner, was briefed on the airport shooting by Broward Sheriffâs office. On his Twitter account, he said the shooter arrived in Fort Lauderdale aboard a flight with a gun in a checked bag. 
""He claimed his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim,"" LaMarca tweeted. 
According to media reports, the suspect took a Delta flight from Anchorage to Minneapolis-St. Paul Thursday night and flew the last leg to Fort Lauderdale Friday morning. 
Sheriff Israel said authorities had not established a motive for the shooting and that it was too early to declare it a terrorist act. 
""At this point, it looks like he acted alone,"" Israel told reporters. He called the shootings a ""horrific, horrific act."" 
A federal law enforcement official, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the case, identified the suspect as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said earlier that the gunman was carrying a military ID in that name. 
The melee, which erupted around 1 p.m. EST, brought air traffic to a standstill at the heavily traveled airport. Some incoming flights were halted on the tarmac and, according to airport director Mark Gale, were likely to be sent to another city without allowing passengers to disembark. 
The shooter, described as slender, about 5-foot-7 and wearing a blue T-shirt, did not say a word during the incident, calmly opening fire as he strolled among passengers at a baggage carousel in Terminal 2, which services Delta flights. 
Mark Lea, a witness among the passengers, told MSNBC the gunman was ""just randomly shooting people"" with a 9 mm pistol and only stopped after emptying about 3 magazines of bullets. 
""He wasn't targeting anyone particular,"" he said. 
Another witness, John Schicher, told MSNBC the shooter appeared to be wearing a blue Star Wars T-shirt. 
The shooting sent people scrambling onto the tarmac, some carrying luggage. Others cowered behind cars. 
Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound. 
Paramedics could also be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. 
Florida Gov. Rick Scott called the shooting a ""senseless act of evil"" and added that he had phoned President-elect Donald Trump to keep him informed about the case. 
Early word on the incident came from a tweet by Ari Fleischer, former White House spokesman for President George W. Bush. ""I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport,"" Fleischer tweeted. ""Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.""

611,TERE004SRC003,"The man suspected of rampantly shooting 13 people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday afternoon, killing five and injuring eight, is a decorated U.S. Army Iraq veteran who flew to South Florida from Alaska -- where he had received mental-health treatment after recently confessing he felt forced to fight for the terrorist group ISIS .
Federal investigators believe Esteban Santiago, 26, landed at Fort Lauderdale early Friday afternoon with a checked firearm. He picked up his case at the Terminal 2 carousel and walked into the men's room, where investigators suspect Santiago loaded the weapon. Then he returned to the baggage claim area -- and pulled the trigger. Witnesses described Santiago firing magazine after magazine of ammunition. In some cases, they feared, he was aiming at his victims' heads.
Broward Sheriff's Office deputies captured Santiago unharmed, without firing a shot of their own, said Sheriff Scott Israel, who wouldn't name Santiago. ""If I had to give a hypothesis based on the knowledge I have at this time, it would be a home-grown violent extremist,"" Israel told ABC News about the gunman, who is believed to have acted alone.
Law enforcement sources confirmed to the Miami Herald that Santiago went to an FBI office in Anchorage in November to confess he felt compelled -- perhaps by voices inside his head -- to fight for ISIS . The feds sent Santiago to get psychiatric help. Investigators are expected to comb through Santiago's social-media profiles and possessions to try to understand his state of mind and possible motives.
Investigators began interviewing Santiago on Friday. A Facebook profile thought to belong to Santiago quickly vanished from the site. So did an Instagram account that appeared to show three photographs of Santiago -- in an Army uniform, with cohorts and with a Puerto Rican flag. Other snapshots showed him in London , with a cousin in Southwest Florida and showing off several tattoos. Whether Santiago owned either or both accounts went unverified by authorities.
Why Santiago was in Fort Lauderdale is unknown. Santiago boarded Delta Air Lines flight 1088 to Minneapolis late Thursday night, said Jesse Davis, police chief at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport . The flight then continued on to Fort Lauderdale . Santiago traveled alone. The only piece of luggage he checked in, Davis said, was a locked handgun.
""It's in accordance with policy [for it] to be in a lockable case,"" Davis said.
Investigators first said they thought Santiago had traveled from Canada . But Air Canada , which had two flights land at around noon Friday, said in a statement it has ""no record of a passenger by the name Esteban Santiago, or checked guns, on any of our flights to Fort Lauderdale ."" A Delta spokesman declined to offer any details on Santiago. Santiago may have argued with some passengers on the flight, the Herald learned.
He had been living in Anchorage , public records show.
He was discharged from the military last summer. Santiago, a former Army private first class, was an Iraq War vet who also served in Puerto Rico and Alaska between December 2007 and August 2016 , according to Air Force Lt. Col. Candis Olmestead
of the Alaska National Guard . Olmstead said Santiago served in Alaska for less than two years, starting Nov. 21, 2014 , and received a ""general discharge"" from the Alaska Army National Guard on Aug. 16, 2016 ""for unsatisfactory performance."" She did not elaborate.
He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard on Dec. 14, 2007 , Olmstead said, deployed to Iraq with the Puerto Rico National Guard from April 23, 2010 , to Feb. 19, 2011 and also did a stint in the Army Reserves before he joined the Army National Guard in Alaska .
The U.S. Army issued a nearly 10-year military record that described Santiago as released from the Alaska National Guard in August to the Inactive Ready Reserve, meaning he could be available for future service. His name is also listed as Esteban Santiago-Ruiz
. His assignments included a short stint at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri , likely for training, and a single deployment -- to Iraq .
He received 10 medals and ribbons for his service, notably the Army Commendation and Good Conduct medals as well as the Iraq Campaign Medal with a campaign star.
In January, Santiago was charged in Alaska with misdemeanor counts of property damage and assault.
The charges stemmed from an alleged assault on his girlfriend at her Anchorage home, according to court records obtained by Alaska Dispatch News . The girlfriend told police that Santiago smashed in her bathroom door and tried to strangle her, although an officer said she did not appear to be injured, the newspaper reported. Santiago was later accused of returning to his girlfriend's house, which he had been ordered to avoid.
A spokeswoman for the Anchorage Police Department referred all questions to the FBI . Santiago's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
Santiago's brother in Puerto Rico told the Associated Press Santiago received psychological treatment in Alaska . Bryan Santiago
didn't know why or how his brother was being treated. He knew of the help from a call his family received in recent months from Esteban Santiago's girlfriend, the AP reported. Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2 years old, according to the AP. Esteban Santiago
grew up in the southern coastal town of PeÃ±uelas. Santiago's aunt, MarÃ­a Ruiz
, told reporters in Union City, New Jersey , that Santiago seemed troubled when he returned from Iraq . According to the Bergen Record, Ruiz said he was ""happy"" after the birth of his baby boy in September. ""I don't know why this happened,"" Ruiz told the Record, as FBI agents showed up at her door.
""Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,"" she added. ""He said he saw things.""

612,TERE005SRC001," Two Chinese nationals of Uyghur origin arrested They have been accused of being members of the IS that carried out the attack, and charged for the murders of the 39 people who died in the January 1 incident. 
Turkish investigators on Friday arrested two Chinese nationals of Uyghur origin in connection with the shooting at an Istanbul nightclub on January 1, 2017, reported Reuters . The incident left 39 people dead at the famous Reina nightclub. Omar Asim and Abuliezi Abuduhamiti have been accused of being part of a militant organisation and charged with 39 counts of murder, reported state-owned news agency, Anadolu. 
The local police had detained 35 people in connection with the shooting, including the two Chinese nationals. The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group, who consider Xinjiang their home. The region was turned into a Chinese province in 1884 under the Qing dynasty. The group largely follows Islam. 
TheIslamic State group had said that they had carried out the attack to avenge deaths in Syria at the hands of Turkish military forces. There has been speculation over the identity of the main accused â he was earlier believed to be a Kyrgyz national. 
On January 4, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had confirmed that authorities had identified the assailant behind the attack, two days after officials had released his photo. However, the Turkish media later said the main accused in the incident had been identified as a jihadist from Uzbekistan, and a member of the Islamic State group. The shooter is still at large.

613,TERE005SRC002,"  Two Chinese nationals of Uyghur origin were arrested yesterday for suspected links to the mass shooting in an Istanbul nightclub on New Yearâs Eve, Turkeyâs state-run Anadolu agency said.
Two suspects, Omar Asim and Abuliezi Abuduhamiti, who are Chinese citizens, were remanded in custody on charges of being members of an armed terrorist organisation, and aiding in 39 counts of murder.
Turkish authorities last week said the man who killed 39 people in an attack on an Istanbul nightclub was probably an ethnic Uyghur.
The Daesh extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.
Anadolu news agency also said 35 people had been detained so far in relation to the attack. Uyghurs were among those detained, local media reports said.
The Uyghurs are a largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority in far western China with significant diaspora communities across Central Asia and Turkey. They claim territory in Chinaâs Xinjiang province, which they call âEast Turkistanâ.
China has a long history of committing human rights abuses and violations against the Uyghurs, whose plight has been largely ignored by the international community. This has led some to be vulnerable to radicalisation by groups like Daesh.
The suspect, who authorities have not named, shot his way into exclusive Istanbul nightclub Reina and opened fire with an automatic rifle, throwing stun grenades to allow himself to reload and shoot the wounded on the ground.
Among those killed in the attack were Turks and visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada.

621,TERE008SRC001,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday claimed that terror attacks at Army installations in Uri and Handwara in Jammu and Kashmir were carried out by Pakistan-based outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

The terrorists had attacked the camp of 30 Rashtriya Rifles camp in Langate in Handwara in October last year. While three attackers were killed by the security forces, one is believed to have escaped, the official said, adding they were looking into it. 

Heavily armed terrorists had stormed the Army base in Uri sector in September and killed 18 soldiers. 

There is proof indicating role of LeT behind Uri and Handwara attacks, he said. 

Earlier, it was claimed that Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) was behind the attacks. 

NIA is looking into both these cases. 

The investigation in Uri attack case will gather pace soon as the agency officials earlier could not visit the points of ingress to verify certain leads due to shelling from across the border, the official said. 

A team of officials is now likely to visit the area from where the terrorists might have entered and attacked the Uri camp, he said. 

Talking about the Handwara incident, NIA officials said they recovered cell phones of Samsung and Huawei companies. These phones worked without SIMs using latest technology and manipulating its configuration, he claimed. 

""The NIA had written to both Samsung and Huawei seeking details of these cell phones including information on shipments. Huawei had informed us that the phone was shipped to Pakistan. We are still awaiting response from Pakistan,"" the official said.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) today contradicted the Indian Army's claims that the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed was behind the Uri terror attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed. A top official of NIA said, that the central agency's investigation had led to a Laskhar-e-Taiba link. The official added, ""Army may have jumped the gun."" 
This is marks the first time that the NIA has officially contradicted the Army's claims. The agency drew reached its conclusion based on three pieces of evidence including data recovered from GPS devices, matrix sheets leading to LeT camps across the Line of Control and the terror group's poster claiming credit for the dastardly attack. 
Japan-made ICOM wireless sets, Taiwan-made Garmin GPS navigation systems, a mobile phone with three SIMS, a special wire-cutter, maps and matrix sheets that helped the militants traverse dense forests, rivers and rocky terrain were amongst the 46 items recovered from Uri encounter site. The attack, which took place on September 18 last year, saw four militants attack an army camp in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. 

Similarly NIA has confirmed that LeT was behind the October 6, 2016 Handwara attack. Three fidayeens dressed in army fatigues were killed in the Handwara encounter after they opened fire outside the 30 Rashtriya Rifles camp at Langate. One fidayeen managed to flee. 
NIA officials confirmed to India Today that the terrorists used ICOM wireless sets and Garmin GPS systems similar to those recovered from the Uri attack site. ICOM sets are synced to Android mobile phones, allowing the operator to send a text message via a mobile app without needing a SIM card. Help has been sought from both, the Japan-based ICOM set makers and the Taiwan-based Garmin manufacturers to further the investigation. 

The National Investigation Agency has managed to trace the origin of one of the phones used in the attack to Pakistan; the phone could provide crucial information. According to NIA sources, the phone was a Huawei device that was shipped to a dealer in Pakistan. 
Another phone, this one a Samsung device, was shipped by a company to Zambia, from where it was further transported to Mauritius before making its way into the hands of the militants involved in the Handwara encounter. The NIA has sought information from Mauritius. 

The investigation agency said Jaish-e-Mohammed was behind the November 2016 Nagrota attack on an Army camp in which two officers and five soldiers lost their lives. Among the evidence is a document bearing the name of Afzal Guru, similar to a piece of paper recovered from a dead terrorist involved in the Pathankot attacks. Other evidence includes an audio clip of Maulana Masood Azhar's brother Abdul Rauf Asghar claiming responsibility for the attack and technical evidence that NIA said would be shared at a later stage.

Two days after an Indian engineer was murdered and another injured in an apparent case of racial hatred, the White House on Friday rejected the suggestion that the incident may have been caused by the anti-immigration climate created by President Donald Trump. 
Asked whether the ârhetoric that the President or â that generally has been out here recently could have contributed in any wayâ to the murder of 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas on Wednesday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: âI mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic, but Iâm not going to get into, like, that kind of â to suggest that thereâs any correlation I think is a bit absurd. So Iâm not going to go any further than that.â 
No Trump tweet 
Mr. Trump did not tweet on the Kansas attack even after it was prominently covered across U.S media platforms. He responded to gun violence in Chicago the same evening with a tweet: âSeven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there â totally out of control. Chicago needs help!â 
Meanwhile, Indian Ambassador to the U.S Navtej Sarna told an audience that included 27 U.S State Governors on Friday evening that India was confident that American administrators would take necessary measures to ensure that such incidents were not repeated. In a first of its kind diplomatic initiative, Mr. Sarna hosted these Governors from both Republican and Democratic Parties, which he said was a demonstration of the bipartisan support for India-U.S. bilateral relations. âI am sure all right-thinking people in America will work together and ensure that this tragic event is behind us,â Mr. Sarna said. Eric Holcomb, Republican Governor of Indiana who recently succeeded Mike Pence who became the Vice President, told The Hindu that regardless of the incident, the American public remained warm towards Indians. 
Blame it on him 
Several U.S lawmakers and civil rights groups condemned the incident and blamed the rhetoric and administrative actions by Mr. Trump for the atmosphere of racial hostility in the country. âWe canât let hatred win,â said Indian-American Senator from California Kamala Harris. âSenseless acts of violence have no place in our country. Iâm heartbroken by this tragedy,â said Pramila Jayapal, Democratic Congresswoman from Washington State. She said hate crimes were rising as a result of Trump administrationâs ideas against immigrants. California Congressman Ro Khanna said: âAny act of violence fuelled by hatred and xenophobia and prejudice cannot be tolerated. I have faith in local and federal law enforcement to justly investigate this shooting as a hate crime.â Illinois Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, California Republican Brad Sherman and Pennsylvania Republican Scott Perry also condemned the incident. âThis was an attack not only on the victims, but on the sense of security of Indians, Indian-Americans, and millions of other people of colour across the nation,â said Mr. Krishnamoorthi.

Kuchibhotla was shot and killed at the bar Wednesday, Feb. 22.
Last week in Kansas, a white man screamed âget out of my country,â before shooting two Indian men at a bar, killing one. But to the White House, that hate crime has nothing to do with President Donald Trumpâs rhetoric. 
During last Fridayâs press gaggle, which The New York Times, CNN and other outlets were blocked from attending, White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied the premise that Trumpâs words resonated with the alleged shooter. 
âI mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic,â Spicer said. âTo suggest that thereâs any correlation I think is a bid absurd. So Iâm not going to go any further than that.â 
Earlier this month, when an Egyptian national brought a machete to the Louvre museum in Paris, Trump was quick in condemning the attack . But when a white supremacist carried out a shooting in Canada, the White House remained mostly silent on the incident. In regards to the recent shooting in Kansas, Spicer said it was too soon to speculate what led to the death of an Indian immigrant. 
âTo right now intimate what the motives are is too early. I mean, I guess my point is to sort of jump to a conclusion. Weâve seen that too often in the past â in Florida and other places where people jump to a conclusion. This is â weâre not going to be subject to calling a video as the Obama administration did,â Spicer said. âI mean, letâs let law enforcement do its job before we start jumping to conclusions.â 
Hereâs how the New York Times described the shooting : âThe Jameson guys,â as some on the staff at Austins Bar and Grill knew the pair, were on the patio on Wednesday evening. It was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India, often enjoyed an after-work whiskey at the bar they had adopted as a hangout. Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out. But a short time later, he came back in a rage and fired on the two men, the authorities said.

At least 21 persons were killed and 59 injured in an explosion at a Coptic Christian church in the Egyptian city of Tanta during a service to celebrate Palm Sunday, the Health Ministry said. 
An explosive device was planted under the front seat of the St George Mar Girgis Church pews where it detonated in the main prayer hall, a security source said. The toll was likely to increase as many of the injured were in critical condition, the Health Ministry said.""Terrorism hits Egypt again, this time on Palm Sunday. Another obnoxious but failed attempt against all Egyptians,"" the Foreign Affairs Ministry tweeted. Palm Sunday is one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. According to CNN, social media video showed crowds gathered outside the church shortly after the attack. Eyewitnesses said the explosion destroyed a wall. President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi said the military hospitals were receiving the wounded. At least 26 ambulances were deployed at the church, about 120 km north of Cairo, Xinhua news agency quoted Magdy Awad, the head of Ambulance Authority, as saying. The security forces intensified their presence around other churches, the country's Interior Ministry said. No group or individual had yet claimed responsibility of the attack. Coptic Christians make up to 10 per cent of Egypt's population. They have largely coexisted peacefully with the majority-Muslim public for centuries. Since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's regime in 2011, the Copts have been facing persecution and discrimination. Dozens have been killed in sectarian clashes. In December 2016, an attack at a Coptic church in Cairo killed 25 people.""Coptic churches and homes have been set on fire, members of the Coptic minority have been physically attacked, and their property has been looted,"" rights group Amnesty International reported in March. Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Cairo this month, where he will meet various religious leaders, including the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church.",TERROR

Local media, Al Arabiya News channel, reported 
The blast happened in Tanta, north of Cairo, at St George Coptic church. 
The incident comes on the Christian celebrations of Palm Sunday.

Last year, 25 people were killed in a suicide bombing that targeted one of Egyptâs largest Coptic cathedrals .",TERROR
650,TERE017SRC003,"Pope Francis condemned a deadly blast at a church in Egypt and said at a Palm Sunday Mass that the world was suffering from wars, terrorism and ""interests that are armed and ready to strike"". 
Francis, who has not made any direct public comment on the current Middle East crisis, said the Mass as international tensions increased following the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, which the Pentagon says was involved in a chemical weapons attack that killed 87 people. 
While the pope, who is due to visit Egypt April 28-29, was celebrating the Mass for tens of thousands of people, the Vatican received word of the blast that killed at least 21 people and injured 50 in a Coptic church in the Nile Delta.
""I pray for the dead and the victims. May the Lord convert the hearts of people who sow terror, violence and death and even the hearts of those who produce and traffic in weapons,"" he said in hastily prepared comments at the end. 
The blast was the latest assault on a religious minority that has increasingly been targeted by Islamist militants, and there have been deep security concerns over the pope's trip. 
Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week that culminates on Easter Sunday, commemorates the day Christians believe Jesus entered Jerusalem and was welcomed as the messiah, only to be crucified five days later. 
Francis, marking the fifth Easter season of his pontificate, blessed palm and olive branches in the center of St. Peter's Square before saying Mass. 
""He (Jesus) is present in our many brothers and sisters who today endure sufferings like his own: they suffer from slave labor, from family tragedies, from diseases,"" he said. 
""They suffer from wars and terrorism, from interests that are armed and ready to strike. Women and men who are cheated, violated in their dignity, discarded,"" he added. 
Before the U.S. missile strike, Francis said he was horrified by the suspected chemical weapons attack, calling it an ""unacceptable massacre"" of innocent civilians. 
Allies of the United States have expressed support for Washington's actions, calling them a proportionate response to Syrian forces' suspected use of chemical weapons. But they were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran. 
Palm Sunday marks the start of a hectic week for the Pope, who on Thursday he visits a prison south of Rome to wash and kiss the feet of 12 inmates, commemorating Jesus' gesture of humility toward his apostles the night before he died. 
Previous popes held the service either at the Vatican or a Rome basilica but Francis changed the tradition to stress the importance of going to the poor, the sick and the imprisoned. 
He has drawn ultra-traditionalist ire for including Muslims and women in a service previously limited to Catholic men. ",TERROR
